This is a trip she has been planning for a few years, this isn't the first time the two of them have taken a vacation together, but it is the first time the trip has been longer than 5 or 6 days.\\n\\nWe have two kids under the age of 12 and so while my wife was on vacation I was solely responsible for their care, getting them to appts, taking care of school stuff. One of our kids is special needs so I wasn't looking forward to doing that stuff alone for two weeks, I only found out she was going for two weeks after she had already booked the trip though and at that point I didn't feel like I could say anything. I take responsibility for not asking for details about the trip before it was booked, or setting boundaries for timelines, though if I had been booking a trip like this I would have checked with her on the duration before doing anything.\\n\\nWhile she was on her trip she messaged me asking if I'd be interested in some custom made clothes. I told her that I'd wear it if she could get something in my size, but I'm a big guy and she was in a country full of small people so I told her that I was concerned that 1) She doesn't know my measurements 2) she's going to end up buying something that wont fit me, which would make me feel bad. Her response was that I shouldn't worry about it and she'd do her best, I again repeated (via text) that my concern was that she was going to spend a bunch of time trying to find clothes for me, and when they don't fit I'm going to feel bad. She again brushed off my concerns saying she wasn't worried about it.  \\n\\n\\nAfter my wife returned from her trip she shared souvenirs with our kids and handed me two shirts, a pair of shorts and a hat. As I tried on each item she giggled because the clothes did not fit, were perhaps comically small (I don't know, I didn't think it was funny). She then handed me two small (think airport sized) bottles of whiskey that she picked up for me. She got small bottles in case I didn't like them, which I didn't really understand. \\n\\nI don't really know how I'm supposed to feel about these gifts, but I feel pretty hurt. I didn't really expect great souvenirs from her for me because she didn't have much luggage space, and often focuses on the kids and nieces anyway, so I had very low expectations to begin with. After completely ignoring my concerns about the clothes though, she giggled when I tried them on and they didn't even come close to fitting which really made me feel bad about myself.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This is a trip she has been planning for a few years, this isn't the first time the two of them have taken a vacation together, but it is the first time the trip has been longer than 5 or 6 days.\\n\\nWe have two kids under the age of 12 and so while my wife was on vacation I was solely responsible for their care, getting them to appts, taking care of school stuff. One of our kids is special needs so I wasn't looking forward to doing that stuff alone for two weeks, I only found out she was going for two weeks after she had already booked the trip though and at that point I didn't feel like I could say anything. I take responsibility for not asking for details about the trip before it was booked, or setting boundaries for timelines, though if I had been booking a trip like this I would have checked with her on the duration before doing anything.\\n\\nWhile she was on her trip she messaged me asking if I'd be interested in some custom made clothes. I told her that I'd wear it if she could get something in my size, but I'm a big guy and she was in a country full of small people so I told her that I was concerned that 1) She doesn't know my measurements 2) she's going to end up buying something that wont fit me, which would make me feel bad. Her response was that I shouldn't worry about it and she'd do her best, I again repeated (via text) that my concern was that she was going to spend a bunch of time trying to find clothes for me, and when they don't fit I'm going to feel bad. She again brushed off my concerns saying she wasn't worried about it.  \\n\\n\\nAfter my wife returned from her trip she shared souvenirs with our kids and handed me two shirts, a pair of shorts and a hat. As I tried on each item she giggled because the clothes did not fit, were perhaps comically small (I don't know, I didn't think it was funny). She then handed me two small (think airport sized) bottles of whiskey that she picked up for me. She got small bottles in case I didn't like them, which I didn't really understand. \\n\\nI don't really know how I'm supposed to feel about these gifts, but I feel pretty hurt. I didn't really expect great souvenirs from her for me because she didn't have much luggage space, and often focuses on the kids and nieces anyway, so I had very low expectations to begin with. After completely ignoring my concerns about the clothes though, she giggled when I tried them on and they didn't even come close to fitting which really made me feel bad about myself.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
