User-generated content has the potential to achieve virality quickly. 
Sometimes referred to as 'campaign' even. Some hashtags die, others become part of world history. 
Typically user-generated viral content is... what? Pithy? Heartstring tugger?
"Early responses" carry cultural weight that buys cultural capital, as evidenced by the "FIRST" or "INB4" internet trends. Cultural capital can translate to real capital for a retail or political enterprise, or more directly to an organization that seeks increased "views" on its ads.
"Early response" can also create the impression of authenticity with the public, with later responses being more and more likely to invoke the suspicion of "bandwagonism".
There is a psychological phenomenon of "social proof" (??? better one???), which in this case: an early, independent "endorsement" of a statement that has innate potential to catch a lot of eyes can stimulate the process of virality, or even possibly serve as the catalyst in that process.
The ability to foresee the imminent virality of user-generated content in the social media space is therefore valuable.
This model assumes that response/recognition is cheap, but missed opportunities are expensive. Therefore it aims to catch as many "peer-endorsement-potentials" as possible (true positives), even if it means mistakenly flagging others (false positives).
