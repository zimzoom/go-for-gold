f3pocga,t3_dhoeql,0,aholo,The Notorious Rapist.
f3p89mm,t3_dhoeql,0,RedditIsDegenerate,Hmmmmm I wonder which sports star this could be. The mind boggles
f3p8b4u,t3_dhoeql,0,Deuteran,Yes it's him.
f3pb48d,t3_dhoeql,0,mink_man,"I still smile at the time last December when all this went on and the mods said the person couldn't be named here.

So people started going - ""It's Sonia O'Sullivan"" and left the comment up yet the comments naming the person was removed, therefore the mods basically confirmed who it was."
f3pfnmt,t3_dhoeql,0,locksymania,I feel like we've been here before with an unamed Irish sports star and their absolute inability to understand (or care) what consent is...
f3p9a7l,t3_dhoeql,0,StillTheNugget,Fisty MacCokehead again. Why does his wife stay with him? Divorce the scummy fuck and take half his everything.
f3poq34,t3_dhoeql,0,SeamusHeaneysGhost,Soniaâ€™s O Sullivans Dacia Duster is covered in evidence I bet.
f3p7vof,t3_dhoeql,0,KoolFM,"Also, donâ€™t link that rag of a paper either!"
f3plkzm,t3_dhoeql,0,MuffledApplause,"Where are his fan boys today? Jesus, last year when it kicked off here they were out in full force, guess it took him slapping an old man in a pub to make them realise that he might be capable of violent assault against a woman too ðŸ™„"
f3qa50x,t3_dhoeql,0,luzzyfumpkins92,Dustin the Turkey sure has fallen from grace lads
f3povnl,t3_dhoeql,0,nelly1313,"The Indo said yesterday, back in December a file was sent to the DPP. I wonder have they decided not to prosecute given it has taken so long. Regardless of who the person is."
f3p9mmr,t3_dhoeql,0,Debeefed,Reddit is not an Irish company so why can't he be named here?
f3rppom,t3_dhoeql,0,StoneTheFlamingCrows,"Doesn't seem to matter in this country - if you've enough money, you can pay your way out of a jail sentence. Even if you're a serial rapist."
f3pltqh,t1_f3p7kzm,0,MuffledApplause,"Absolutely, but simply because it might damage the case against him in the courts. Donâ€™t mention his name if you believe you know it (I think we all do) and let him feel the full force of the law, enough is enough. Scumbag of the highest degree"
f3pfqjj,t1_f3p7kzm,0,consaw_,are we boards dot ie now
f3pkkmr,t1_f3p7kzm,0,Irish_Maverick,"Could I post a completly unrelated video about an Irish sport star who definitely is not the one named in the thread with the wording being, on an unrelated note have you seen this video of this Irish sports star?"
f3q0fz8,t1_f3pocga,0,NeasM,"Same lad who drinks ""Proper Rapist"" ?"
f3p8usd,t1_f3p89mm,0,Debeefed,Was it Wally? People have been looking for him for ages.
f3pkmql,t1_f3pb48d,0,Irish_Maverick,"Fecking Sonia again, she's an aggressive one."
f3pf5qd,t1_f3pb48d,0,A3A6,it's mink_man
f3q284f,t1_f3pb48d,0,ClogBriste,Really? Cos I remember even the most blatantly joking answers being removed.
f3r5c1w,t1_f3pb48d,0,CaptainEarlobe,I think they're more worried about causing the case to be thrown out than protecting mcrapey
f3pm305,t1_f3pfnmt,0,Nelly_the_irelephant,Ah come on. He's just an inner city kid trying to do right by his cocaine habit and tenancy to turn into a gigantic rapey cunt (allegedly)
f3pgkmp,t1_f3p9a7l,0,That_irishguy,They are not married so no divorce
f3pe04v,t1_f3p9a7l,0,binhoker666,he played it smart and didnt marry her...hes a wanker got

f3p9ly4,t1_f3p9a7l,0,None,[removed]
f3ptunz,t1_f3plkzm,0,BackToTheFifa,I'd say the conclusive video evidence helped
f3six3w,t1_f3plkzm,0,yurtcityusa,Pretty sure that old man is the father of a cartel hitman lol
f3qjc8c,t1_f3qa50x,0,ghostofgralton,"After that gold medal in the Olympic flapflaps, things just went downhill. Truly a fowl fate"
f3qbadb,t1_f3povnl,0,johnbonjovial,That always confused me. I read that she presented to the guards in a highly distressed state and i believe made a statement ? It seemed like the poor girl had a horrible time. Then a few months later mr x is doin his thing on social media as if nothing happened at all ??  Assuming all these accusations are true (which i donâ€™t know) - heâ€™d have to be a legit psychopath. Time will tell i guess.
f3p9ssz,t1_f3p9mmr,0,horny4decolonization,Individual users can be held responsible though
f3pa31l,t1_f3p9mmr,0,Elbon,"Because saying someone committed a crime before their found guilty is a scumbag thing to do. Even if you preface it with ""accused"" there always going to be that stigma. Everyone just needs to have a bit of cop on with throwing around names."
f3p9tjg,t1_f3p9mmr,0,pmckizzle,"Im not explaining it again, https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/about/rules"
f3pq78b,t1_f3pltqh,0,pmckizzle,yes exactly! the rule was brought in after that rape trial collapsed because the defense said he'd had an unfair trial by public and it would be impossible for him to have a fair trial.
f3pv4sc,t1_f3pltqh,0,consaw_,"Is reddit Ireland hosted in Ireland, if not it shouldn't be an issue

""u'll dooo foookin nuttin"""
f3pgbo8,t1_f3pfqjj,1,Owwmykneecap,The random fucks that are the mods here now think we are.
f3q1kvf,t1_f3q0fz8,0,aholo,Yep thatâ€™s the Proper Notorious Rapist.
f3pllka,t1_f3pkmql,0,consaw_,She hasn't been the same since she skuttered her pants in that race years ago

f3qs7xe,t1_f3pm305,0,auburnb,Since when is Drimnagh inner city?
f3qek4n,t1_f3pgkmp,0,Phannig,Probably easier to wait for the inevitable overdose and get everything..
f3qv56c,t1_f3pgkmp,0,Cyclical-DingDongs,under the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 she would be fully entitled to a chunk of his estate upon the break down of the relationship
f3pdvns,t1_f3p9ly4,0,MrSnare,Mrs. Krabappel And Principal Skinner Were In The Closet Making Babies And I Saw One Of The Babies And Then The Baby Looked At Me
f3pb6jv,t1_f3p9ly4,0,mink_man,"Woah lad.

It's more likely she's living a life of insane riches. She's already popped 2 kids out."
f3padfe,t1_f3p9ly4,0,None,Christ on a bike; we don't know that! Stop saying shite you can't verify!
f3paeg8,t1_f3p9ly4,0,12YearOldGayKids,Absolutely everything you've said here is pure speculation.

f3quayz,t1_f3qbadb,0,Nelly_the_irelephant,"Mr X? Come on. Call this person what they are, Consentless McRapeor."
f3pi8gm,t1_f3p9ssz,0,das_punter,Would Reddit give up their personal details?
f3p9x3g,t1_f3p9ssz,0,Debeefed,Makes sense.
f3pcitm,t1_f3pa31l,0,SemperVenari,Agreed. I think anonymity pending conviction should be extended if anything
f3p9wbl,t1_f3p9tjg,1,Debeefed,Didn't ask you.
f3q1o8w,t1_f3q1kvf,0,NeasM,Heard it taste like shit anyway so not suprised.
f3pmgcu,t1_f3pllka,0,Irish_Maverick,Some say it awakened something in her. A desire that can never be fulfilled.
f3r32dc,t1_f3qttx6,0,Tote_Sport,"Ah heâ€™s a mad one when heâ€™s on the drink.

Heâ€™s an absolute divil for the oul nose treats too"
f3qqtml,t1_f3pdvns,0,ghetto_cornetto,The baby looked at you?!
f3qo06e,t1_f3pi8gm,0,youre-a-cat-gatter,Yes
f3qumo4,t1_f3pi8gm,0,thefroggfather,"Yes.

Operate in a EU country you comply by their rules. Sure the Garda could even just walk to their Dublin offices with a data access request.

If they think there is some spastic on reddit helping this sports star defense by naming him, they will pay that person a visit for breaking the law.

The law is in place to stop bias jury selection. If you dislike this sports star, the actual most damaging thing you can do is keep your mouth shut. Naming and shaming is a sure way to collapse the case against him and allow him to go free."
f3pa75n,t1_f3p9wbl,0,ClogBriste,"You didn't ask anyone in particular, who did you want to answer?"
f3s01o4,t1_f3p9wbl,0,toomuchcoffee2,"Such a childish reply, I love it."
f3p9ylf,t1_f3p9wbl,0,pmckizzle,well since im one of the ones enforcing the rules...

f3r53hw,t1_f3qumo4,0,hurpyderp,Why doesn't naming people for every crime that isn't sex related lead to every jury being biased then?
