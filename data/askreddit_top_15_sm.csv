I had the pleasure of working under him for some pop culture conventions and all he wanted was to see fans smile and enjoy his legacy.  He loved to joke with those around him, and he would tease the ever loving hell out of everyone he could.  

I remember him using his motorised scooter to get around backstage and his poor assistant would speed walk to keep up with him, but he would just keep increasing the speed until she was running beside him. A wicked grin on his face the whole time. 

Or how he would constantly make his staff repeat themselves ""what I didn't hear you!"" Untill they had repeated themselves four times, witnessing that initially made me sad, thinking his hearing was poor, until he looks at me with that same grin and winks.  

My time with him was short, but I'm so glad I got it, this man changed my life before I even met him, and he made a huge impact when I did as well.

Here we were, just average idiots in a place we weren’t supposed to be. 

We approached, just wanting to say hello and thank him for his work. The handlers were not having any of it and started to move us along. He stopped the handlers and said hello to us. I got to shake his hand and thank him. He asked if we had cameras. I was kinda dumb-struck by the moment, and forgot cameras existed. He actually wanted to pose for pictures with us.

Still have the photo, and a nice memory of a pretty great guy who was good to his fans.

About 4-5 years ago I was in Chicago going to school for animation.

Comicon was in town but I had to work and didn’t have the money to go anyways.

Anyways I worked at Dunken Donutes and got good with the owner so I was basically his errand boy. 

I was delivering bagels and donutes to another store on foot. I was standing at the corner of wabash and another street, forgot the name, waiting for the light so I could catch a train to another part of downtown.

Next to me was this old man with white hair and shades. I am a pretty talkative person but instead I found myself just staring at him.

He caught me staring and raised his eyebrows at me. I apologized and explained that he just looked so familiar...


He winked at me and said, “I get that a lot.”

Turned and walked away. About an hour later I found out Stan Lee was in Chicago for that Comicon and I’ve been kicking myself ever since.

He was up there with Toriyama Akira and Hayao Miyazaki for me. The people I’ve always wanted to just sit down with and drink coffee.

Spider-Man was always my favorite, because I was a weird kid and found spiders fascinating. I loved him more as I grew up, because there were so many similarities: raised in poor families beset by financial troubles. Quick with jokes to cover insecurities. A deep love of science that shaped everything I did. The implicit knowledge that I may not be the strongest, or the toughest, or the most resilient, but that I always had to stand back up. Intellectually gifted and, with it, a compulsory, driving need to use that to help people. It's why I became a scientist researching psychiatric illnesses, and then later Alzheimer's disease, because I recognized that I had a gift - and so I had a responsibility.

Spider-Man is paper and ink, but he is an ideal I always have, and always will, aspire to. He is my hero. And the man who helped give me that ideal, who shaped so much of my childhood and identity, has died, and the world is a sadder place.

I knew Stan Lee before I knew who the hell he was. He was the guy with the cool voice who narrates my spiderman game on N64 when I was a child. It wasn’t until years later that I learned it was his voice, but even before then I learned the name of Stan Lee. He helped create my favorite superhero, Spiderman. He gave my father a line of comics to pass down to me and form a closer connection between the two of us. And he created a character who taught me that I’m not powerless just because I was a kid. 



While it’s easy to write off comic books as a child’s entertainment medium, his work really did have a lasting impact on my life, and that impact has in turn helped me touch the lives of others with his works. I NEVER discuss this outside of my clinical setting, but I use the themes and tropes of Spider-Man in my practice to help clients, many of whom are not particularly intellectual, understand concepts like codependency and hero complexes. Thanks to Stan, I’m able to explain very complex ideas to my clients and help them overcome what I’ve come to call “Peter Parker Syndrome.” So, even beyond his personal impact on my own life, I owe Stan Lee a great debt. 



His is an influence that will be missed. Marvel games, movies, and media at large will simply not be the same without him. Through the act of creating superheroes, Stan Lee himself became a superhero, a household name that influenced generations of people all around the world. May he Rest In Peace, but may his legacy continue to resonate with men and women of all ages for generations to come.

Edit: since people were asking what “Peter Parker Syndrome” is, I’ll copy/paste my response here. It’s an allegory I use to illustrate certain themes:


It’s how I explain codependency and hero complex to clients. 


I started by introducing Spider-Man and his real identity. I outline to my client that, once Peter gets his powers, he goes all in on being spiderman. A running theme in the books is that spiderman is the real identity, and Peter Parker is the “disguise.” 


Anyway, Peter goes all in on being spiderman, and it starts to fuck with his life. He loses his girlfriend, drops out of school/loses his job, and loses touch with family. But he doesn’t care, because he gets to be the hero and that’s what matters most to him.


Time passes, and a villain shows up. Wipes the floor with spiderman. Then he realizes that the one thing he cares about, being the hero, he can’t even do anymore. In some storylines, he gives up and puts away the costume. Slowly but surely, he rebuilds his life. He starts dating again, re enlists in school/gets a new job, starts having hobbies again. And for the first time in a long time, Peter is happy.


Then the villain comes back. In the absence of anyone else who can help, he inevitably puts the mask back on and fights. And he wins. And what he learns (and then unlearns because the universe is reset) is that, in order to be a good spiderman, he has to be a good Peter Parker. And when Peter suffers, so does Spiderman.

I then relate the client’s self care to their “Peter Parker” and their desire to be there and care for others to their “Spiderman,” to illustrate that they cannot engage in the selfless acts they want to if they do not take care of themselves first.


A seemingly simple idea that a lot of my clients struggle to wrap their head around. I then have them keep a running tab of how Peter Parker is doing each day to find gaps in self care.",Stan Lee has passed away at 95 years old,0

I learnt more from spider-man about responsibilities then anyone.

She walks all the way up to Stan and he talks with her for a minute or two and signs the photo.

That’s where I saw Wizard magazine (#34) for the first time, which featured on its cover an illustration of Rogue and Psylocke of the X-Men. I was somewhat familiar with Batman, Spider-Man, and Superman, but I really didn’t know of any female superheroes (aside from Wonder Woman, who frankly seemed pretty lame to me as a kid) at that time. I bought the magazine, and for months, it was an obsession for me. I read it over and over again. I started buying comic books, drawing characters, reading the stories out loud in the voices I imagined each character to have, dreaming up new powers and imagining new worlds. What I loved about the Marvel universe was that there was room for everybody: men, women, people of different races, nationalities, ages, abilities, and backgrounds. It made me feel like comic books were something that everyone could enjoy. I shared my love for comic books with my brother. Although he struggled in school and teachers couldn’t get him to focus, he would pay attention when I read The Uncanny X-Men to him, and when he finally learned to read, it was because of comic books. Thanks to Stan Lee for showing us that anyone can be a hero. RIP. ",Stan Lee has passed away at 95 years old,0

He was being escorted outdoors, along the main glass hallway where all the talks were happening. It was so hot, and he was wearing his signature yellow sweater vest and keeping pace with his assistants. I couldn't believe my eyes. I was just hanging outside, and there he was, steady as he goes. I yelled at him the only thing I could, "" I LOVE YOU STAN!"".

I didn't expect him to hear me since there was a good amount of distance between us and he was hurrying to his panel (The Amazing Stan Lee). But no, with double barrel fingers towards me, not missing a beat, that firm, unmistakable Stan voice we all have grown accustomed to all these years, I hear, ""Love you too!"".
 
Many years later me and three friends go for a group photo. There was a kid before us, and Stan made sure to take time with the young boy and not let the photographs rush thier moment. 
Once our photo was taken. I noticed how smaller he was now, not weak, but small like my own grandma. Instead of thanking him, I just told him I loved him. He didn't hear me but it didn't matter. 

Out of all the stories and heros and villans he gave us, Stan was the truest hero and champion of our hearts and imaginations. 

Stan was the man. He never let us down, and in his memory I/we should try to be like Stan. Ever moving, bending, steadfast, and fighting for the future for ourselves and others in ways that we can.

First of all, he lived a long life. 95 years.

They played them over the voice over, so it was louder and actually sounded like an emergency vehicle was close. I'd gotten fooled more than I'd like to admit by it. I always checked my mirrors to see if any emergency vehicle was coming, luckily none ever did. It got to the point where I stopped listening to it all together. My view on it is that they could desensitize people to sirens ""Oh just the radio station again"" and I would assume people have blocked emergency vehicles without realizing. People already do it enough as is. I'd be happy if they removed any sounds that are meant to grab peoples' attention while driving such as sirens, horns, squealing tires, or wrecks just to name a few.

Hear me out - I discovered through therapy that I needed a mechanism for judgement-less and objective self-analysis and Mr. Spock is that dude. He can see the most fucked up space shit ever and react calmly and objectively.


Mr. Spock: ""The massive space blob has a 97.454% chance of consuming the ship and everyone inside within 4/7 minutes. Projections show it will be slow and painful.""


Kirk: ""That's horrible!""


Spock: ""Yes, it is not ideal for our continued survival, but it's actions are entirely within the nature of the space blob.""


So, whenever I get spun up on something in my head I imagine a mini-Spock in my head with a science terminal that can pull all data about ME. 


me: ""Spock, science report.""


Spock: ""Data shows that godspeedmetal is 5.8 days from quitting smoking tobacco and is under great mental distress from the change of chemical intake. He isn't consciously aware of it, but he's attempting to make up an excuse to get gas on a half-tank in order to create an opportunity to buy a pack of cigarettes.""


me: ""Thank you, Spock, sounds like I'm being dishonest with myself. I suck!""


Spock: ""I disagree. It's entirely within the nature of a nicotine addict to seek out a source of nicotine intake. This is neither Good or Bad. Just natural. Data also suggests that conscious awareness mitigates the chances of nicotine intake by 89.45%. You've yet to procure a nicotine source as well. Commendable.""


Just going through that mental exercise will help knock me out of a mental spun-up state, help sort out emotions, feelings, all that stuff, into a parsed, objective, and most importantly, non-judgemental way.

EDIT: holy shit, I'm happy this was received as well as it was. This mechanism has helped myself so much, however I'd offer a couple of words of advice if you are intending to take on this method as well because it can be a frustrating mechanism to employ if you don't have your expectations set correctly. 

One - Spock's reports WILL be amended, appended, referenced and reworked entirely. This is all part of the process. Even Spock had several times where extended analysis was needed to understand something in order to create a way to cope/overcome/whathaveyou. Don't treat everything he says as immutable truth - his analysis is only as good as the data he is able to receive through that mental science terminal. Your initial reports will upgrade that terminal for stronger analysis in the future.

Two - You WILL fail, as well, and that's totally OK! He's analyzed far more for me than just smoking - everything from anxiety, struggles with work, and interpersonal relationships has been reviewed through that science terminal. But sticking with the smoking report as an example - recognizing that ""getting gas"" was just an excuse to get cigarettes didn't come from a single analysis, but was referenced from a prior ""science report"", as at one point I had quit smoking, went to get gas a few days later and drove away with a pack of cigs in my pocket. Spock reported, ""godspeedmetal formulated a reason to create an environment that allowed his weakened will to procure a source of nicotine. Further analysis shows that nicotine addiction is extremely subversive to godspeedmetal's psyche at a subconscious level. The strength of control the addiction exerts upon his mind is quite strong. *Fascinating.*"" Spock doesn't judge me - it all is what it is - and I respond, ""That IS fascinating! My mind is stranger than I ever thought possible. However, I am more in control because I now recognize this pattern of behavior. I believe that this can be identified at a later point if I do this again. Thank you, Spock."" That failure to stop smoking at that time was an opportunity to learn about myself. And FYI - I'm several months smoke free and still going!

Three - this isn't to make someone an emotionless logic machine, either - Spock understands human nature is an emotional experience. Humans get horny, sad, happy, angry, depressed, excited - all of that stuff that comprises the human condition - it's all part of the Logic of Being Human. Take that into account, yet strive to be aware of your humanity and make conscious decisions on what you do instead of sub-consciously reacting emotionally.

Four - trust your intuition. Your instincts have been developed over millions of years of evolution. Your mind is *powerful* and can sub-consciously recognize threats and boons to your world and yourself. Even if you don't understand *why* your guts are reacting they way they are, don't dismiss it. Run it by Spock and if you don't come to a satisfactory answer, you can always revisit later when you've more experience, time, and data.","Anthony Bourdain once said ""There's a guy in my head, and all he wants to do is lay in bed all day long, smoke pot, and watch old movies and cartoons.

* Commercial Spaceflight - Its literally here right now, but its going to get even cheaper in the future. The next step will be space tourism, but that won't be accessible to the average person for a few decades at least.

* Space Construction - We've already done this with space stations, but cheaper commercial spaceflight will encourage larger buildings in space. Instead of launching completed modules like we have in the past, we're going to be launching subdivisions of modules that will dwarf even the ISS. I'm incredibly optimistic about whatever happens to be the ""next ISS"".

* Asteroid Mining - This one we probably won't see in our lifetimes, (unless the futurists are right, and the first person to live to 200 is alive today). However, the potential of asteroid mining is astronomical! There are individual asteroids with more platinum and tungsten on them than the entire Earth has available. Once we have these materials in excess, who knows what new developments we'll see. Aluminum used to be exceedingly difficult to refine and rare. Once a reliable refining process was developed, we found a myriad of uses for aluminum that changed the world. I predict we'll see similar benefits from improved access to rare metals found abundantly in asteroids.

* Space tourism - Now that we've got commercial spaceflight, and space construction is on the horizon, space tourism will become a booming industry. I'd be excited to spend a week on a luxury space station in the future. 

* Mars - We're definitely going at some point, whether it is publicly or privately funded. I doubt there are any monsters there, or that we'll have any visitors forced to grow potatoes with their excrement. However, Mars is the next logical destination for humanity's domination of the solar system. I hope I live to see the first colonization effort!","With all of the negative headlines dominating the news these days, it can be difficult to spot signs of progress.

That's easy - the past.  People live in this weird bubble of time that seems to them to encompass everything but in reality is the tiniest fraction of a drop in the bucket of human society.  We really just don't have a good sense of how *bad* things used to be, even only just a few hundred years ago.

A few examples: look how upset we get when ISIS does something horrible, like burning someone alive or murdering everyone in a village.  It's front-page news.  It's a huge outrage.  But five hundred years ago, it was *totally normal.*  It was something *governments* did, and not just now and then but as a matter of course.  ""Kill the men and enslave the women"" wasn't seen as barbarous, it was just business as usual.

Hell, let's one-up that.  Five hundred years ago in South America, motherfuckers were *eating each other* like it was something to do.  The entire continent was run by massive empires of cannabalistic slave-holders who thought about human sacrifice the way we think about American Idol.  We think about how brutal the Conquistadors were by our standards; realize that the people they pushed out of power were *even worse than that!*

Shit, look at the last century!  Communism killed a hundred million people, Nazism got a few tens of millions more, and that's before we go into all the ""minor"" genocides here and there.  We are *so much better off* than people can possibly comprehend.

Congressional members aren't paid from annual appropriations and are paid through a salary not based on hours worked, but as their status as members. More importantly, members of Congress are constitutional officers. The President (and life-tenured federal judges) is also a constitutional officer and also cannot be prevented from carrying out their duties except as allowed in the Constitution. As such, they're all constitutionally entitled to pay.

Article 1, Section 6 of the Constitution:

>The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.

27th Amendment:

>No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.

It also functionally wouldn't do much besides perhaps damage the one or two financially untenable younger members (AOC for example). The shutdown and pay being withheld impact only those employees that *need* that money imminently, which is not the vast majority of Congress and certainly not the President.

If you're making 500K selling your soul to a big corporation, than your check for being a part of congress is an after thought. Mean while freshmen senators who realistically spent nearly all of their money on campaigning to get into congress and change a broken system will be the only ones to suffer. 

So this could just help the spread of corruption against high ranking government members. Although why should they be exempt from suffering the way TSA workers or Prison workers do?

I feel that instead of stopping anyone from getting payed, if a budget isn't agreed upon, than we have an emergency 3 months airbag where we pay federal workers for those 3 months and essentially use the previous budget. If those 3 months go by and still no movement is made, then there should be repercussions for congress and the presidency. Something along the lines of an immediate replacement of all leading members of congress and a removal of the current president. This later one is dangerous because there are times that congress would be willing to kill it's self to kick a sitting president out of power, such as republicans during the Obama administration, and I suspect Democrats during the Trump administration.

Additionally congress should be forced into a minimum of 8 hour work days with the president sitting in on the meeting trying to find a compromise. There should be no vacations, time off, or excuses with the exception of terminal illness. If a member of congress fails to show up, they would effectively be removed from congress, and if the sitting President or Vice President is not there than their power to veto a budget will be removed and it would only take both houses to confirm a budget.","[Serious] Americans, would you be in support of putting a law in place that government officials, such as senators and the president, go without pay during shutdowns like this while other federal employees do?

I think people should be organ donors but it should be something they consciously decide to do, not because they didn't get around to filling out the paperwork.

Their parliament, the Althing, has been in continuous session since 986 - not 1986 - and has a rather unusual track record of keeping the interests of Icelanders at the forefront of its decisions.  Every Icelander's DNA is stored at a central repository and companies like decode Genetics have access to this DNA; along with Iceland's unique patronymic/matronymic naming system and the records of the Althing, many avenues of research, from the geneaologic to the medical, are available.  The Althing granted broad consent for this work in the early 2000s and although individual Icelanders may opt out only a few dozen had done so the last time I looked into it.

I think Iceland's relative cultural homogeneity, its small population, and its position as the only society inhabiting a place that is rather forbidding 6 months out of the year has something to do with making this possible.

About ten years ago my mother at age 69 had a massive stroke. They didn't expect her to live let alone come out of it mostly alright. Which she did except for some vision loss in her left eye. (Not total, just peripheral.) So she can only see perfectly straight out of that eye.

So after about a year recovering from the stroke and the ensuing infection from the surgery that ended up being worse then the stroke itself she decides she wants to go get tested to see if she can retain her drivers license. (Required by law in my province of Canada).

My father was not well either as he had a long term terminal illness so I pack them both up in my truck and take them to the DMV. Me and my father happily assuming there is no fucking way in hell she will pass. 

Aside from her vision issues, the amazingly quick witted and swift woman I grew up with was VERY unsure of her self at all times and took forever to make the smallest decisions. It broke my heart and it didn't even occur to me to be scared that she would get her license back.

Well she did, passed with ""Flying colors"" the DMV guy said. As a SAR (Search and Rescue) tech, the idea of taking him up in the helicopter and throwing him out without a rope occurred to me.

1 week later, accident number one. T-boned a poor lady as she was coming out of the grocery store. Not much damage and no injuries thankfully. Mother still refused to admit she wasn't fit to drive.

Month later, accident 2. She panics on a multi-lane cross city road and ends up on the raised median and rips the entire exhaust system off her car. Still won't admit any issues.

At this point I'm amazed I didn't have ulcers. Shortly after accident 2 my father passed away. I did everything up to and including begging to get her to give up the license. She wouldn't do it and for the next few months I spent every day with a knot in my stomach until I spoke to her around 6pm every night once she was ""home from running around"" 

Then around 1pm I get a call from her cell phone, this phone I bought her that she mostly ignored except to charge it. I couldn't understand a word she said she was so upset on the phone. I managed to get her general location out of her and hopped in a car and more then exceeded the speed limit getting down there.

Upon arriving there are two ambulances, shoes in front of her car and its up on the curb.

She's sitting on the curb next to it bawling her eyes out and I'm terrified she's killed someone.

Turns out a man and his son were walking out of the soccer pitch next to the road, began to cross on the cross walk and she didn't see them.

She thankfully only struck the father and aside from being banged up he wasn't super seriously injured.

Because of my job I knew most of the police officers in the city so one of them offered to follow me back to her house so she could take me back down to get her car.

By the time I had done so and got back to her condo she had stopped crying. Threw me the extra set of keys to the car she had and told me to get rid of the car.

She even tried to get the DMV worker that passed her fired after that. She immediately realized she shouldn't of ever gotten it back. She was actually terrified that she had been driving like that.

Years later she still comments about how she never even saw the man and his son and how she could of killed one or both of them.

I have all the respect in the world for seniors. My mother was one of the first women CEO's in this province and was a hellcat in her day. I learned a lot from her. But I also learned to accept limitations.

If you are older reading this post. If you think for even a second that you could maybe not be the safest person to be on the road, talk to and listen to your loved ones.

Its horrible to give up that freedom, it would be more horrible for you to kill some innocent person because you are too proud to give it up.

* Minimalism/Flat design, mostly due to the rise of tablets and browsing the internet on mobile devices. Clean lines, simple colors like black, white and grey.

* TV commercials: Early 2010s ads are backed by upbeat xylophone/triangle/whistling/hand clapping music, or people breakdancing or doing “the worm” to obnoxious dubstep music. The late 2010s have vivid colors and imagery, vaporwave-style aesthetics, and loud over-the-top spokespeople talking fast in the middle of the screen (think “Captain Obvious” from the Hotels.com commercials or Terry Crews from the Old Spice commercials)

* Entering a new golden age of automotive design. Almost every new car from the decade is elaborately styled. Car interiors with angular, intricate dashboards (like the Ford Escape, Chevy Equinox or Hyundai Santa Fe). This might end in the 2020s as crash safety technology requires more new cars to look the same, and car interiors will replace dashboards and gauges with touch screens (Thanks, Tesla).

* A move away from chain restaurants and the rise of food trucks and locally-owned restaurants that all feature string lighting, outdoor tables with giant Jenga blocks, Edison bulbs, and a craft beer selection written on a chalkboard.

* All houses are painted in that “griege” color and have all-white kitchens with that same white subway tile backsplash.

However, the (r)evolution was somewhat organic, and even though we experienced an economic downturn, the future looked bright.

The 10s were plastic. We let a reality TV show host become president. We realized the dystopian future that we read about in books and saw in movies. The boundaries of what is real have been stretched and shattered. The rich are living in a separate reality in their high rises and the poor are killing each other in the streets.

* An increase in small-dollar donations for political candidates, especially on the left.
* Increasing partisanship between the left and the right.
* A swing towards progressivism on the left (as seen by the rise of Sanders, Warren and AOC).
* The (slow) weakening of the Religious Right, as evidenced by the willingness of evangelicals to look the other way on their 'moral purity' tests, and the (depressingly speedy) rise of the Nationalist Right.

I bought a laptop from Dell, and from day 1 it was so riddled with problems, it was unusable. The simplest tasks took forever. Wifi, Ethernet and more crashed continuously, requiring a full power cycle to work again. Formatting & reinstalling Windows did nothing. Worst of all, Dell support did nothing but delay and delay.

One day I finally managed to have a Dell tech over to check it out. He confirmed the countless issues and called up Dell to say I require a replacement. I wait. He hangs up, and looks at me. ""Sorry... Red light"" (= no-go). And he had to leave me with this quite literal brick.

Late last year I found out that as consumer in the EU (The Netherlands specifically) I am well protected against this. I consulted with a bureau, and they believe that even though so much time has now passed, with such an extreme case, I am still able to get my $1000 back if I pursue it.

So that's exactly what I'm doing. I'm getting my money back from them, one way or another. Dell can go fuck themselves.

Edit: definition of ""red light"" added

Edit 2: Gold?! Thank you! Honestly, I thought this would get burried, but as a returning Dell customer that they royally screwed over, I'm happy this is getting the attention it is.

I consider it for a moment, inspecting each of the bills before nodding once and tucking it neatly into my coat. I turn around, inputting 6 digits into a wall-mounted safe. Inside is a brick and a remote. I turn around to him, offering the brick as I slip the remote into my pocket alongside the cash.

""Wait a minute..."" Realization begins to dawn on his face. ""You're... you're that guy from before.""

""I am.""

""Look, I'm sorry, man, but reddit made me do it. I'm sorry, but I'm not buying a thousand-dollar brick from you.""

""That's ok."" I turn around, tossing the brick back into the safe, where it lands with a *thunk* against the metal.

""Could I at least get my money back?""

""Sure. Have it back."" Reaching into my jacket pocket, my hand instead comes out with the remote. He begins to realize that something is wrong, but before he can do anything, I press the button and a hidden hatch in the ceiling above him slams open.

A rash reaction will only inflame things further. I would memorise the scammers facial features and bide my time stewing. 

Once I’d made the stew, I would begin to plot my revenge. Whilst eating the stew I imagine the answer would come to me. And as I’m sure you know, the answer involves constructing a multi-million dollar gravy and soup based corporation.

To begin, I need to recoup my losses. This will involve buying an ox and creating a mill and also heading into town to your local stationary supplier and picking up several small zip lock bags. I would first break up the brick into smaller pieces before placing them in the mill. Then I would use the ox to power the machine and keep going until the brick is ground down to a fine powder. Having achieved a good consistency, I would then seperate the ground up brick into very small amounts and put them in the zip lock bags.

Now wait for a Saturday night and head into town. Go to an establishment selling alcohol and playing popular music (or “pop” music as I believe it’s known) and look around. You’re looking for a particular type of person. He will be young, male, socially awkward; and trying desperately hard to impress every single female in the building but having no luck. Go and speak to him. Empathise with his struggles. Tell him that you might know a way that is guaranteed to improve his success with women. Tell him he needs to know about BRIX; the latest hallucinogenic substance from south of the border. BRIX is the drug of choice of the elite, the influencers, the popular. It’s a fine, red powder that comes in small zip lock bags. It doesn’t leave you half baked, it leaves you kiln baked. Tell him that you know an “importer of exotic substances” and that in 6 weeks time there will be a supply of BRIX in this very city; and that he (YES HE!) could be the only supplier. Imagine how popular he would be, especially with all those attractive women. Now take his number, tell him that you’ll be in touch; and let the hype grow.

After 6 weeks or so meet your contact and supply him with BRIX. Tell him to distribute the goods quickly and that you expect payment within 2 days. If I’ve learnt anything about drug dealing from watching movies (and I haven’t), it’s that this should net you about 2 million dollars (after tax of course). You may want to leave town for a while as inhaling brick dust can cause an incurable lung disease.

Whilst holidaying in Tahiti, instruct a legal professional to set up a company based in Kentucky. Call this company “Condiments Of Choice (Kentucky)”. With the company established, it’s time to get a marketable product. That means it’s time for a heist. Head to your local ski shop and purchase two sets of balaclavas or preferably bandanas. Then buy two horses. You probably won’t find them at the ski shop. Finally you’ll need 4 Colt 1851 Navy revolvers. The “Navy” is part of the name, not the colour of the gun. Contact your BRIX dealer again. At this point he will be desperate to escape the clutches of the law and will gladly follow you into criminal activity if it means you will get him across the border to Mexico. Head down to San Bernardino, California. Here you will find the Cajon rail pass, just 65 miles from downtown LA. Set yourself up by the tracks and wait. 

That’s right, it’s time to hijack the gravy train! You see, everyone talks about gravy boats; but that’s just a myth spread by “BIG GRAVY”. The real money is on the gravy train. It’s easily identifiable by the large gravy tankers it pulls, along with two very secure cargo cars. Inside these cars you’ll find all of the big gravy companies secret formulas. Ride your horse up alongside the train and climb aboard. Expect heavy resistance and shoot to kill. The hienz henchmen won’t hesitate to drown you in a vat of perfectly heated gravy if given the chance. Get to the safe and get the hell out of there and back to the Condiments Of Choice (Kentucky) head office. Once back at COC(K), use the secret formula to both blackmail rival companies and to improve on it to create your own condiment empire.

After several years of successful condiment creation, you may remember the reason you started on this journey; revenge. Cook yourself a stew, and let’s get to work. As your COC(K) is now the largest distributer of sauces in the world, you have developed a great deal of knowledge about your consumers; including one who appears to make absurd amounts of money selling bricks. Armed with his address you need to create a special gravy granule canister. It needs to have a plastic insert and a release mechanism built in so that when he removes the insert, the bag splits open and gravy granules pour out everywhere. That will show him. Now get in touch with your partner in crime from the gravy train heist. This is it buddy, one last job and then it’s margarita’s on a Mexican beach for you my friend.

Contact the scammer. Tell him that he (YES HE!) is the lucky winner of a years supply of COC(K) gravy and that someone will be visiting him in the next few days with the symbolic first canister. Pass the canister of gravy granules to your associate. When he arrives at the scammers location get him to hand over the tin and then take a photo with the scammer holding both the gravy, and a banner saying “I LOVE COC(K)!”. You can frame this later. Then at dinner, when he goes to make his gravy; BAAM! Gravy granules everywhere!

Of course if he paid any attention as he is cleaning up the mess, he would notice that the granules weren’t brown but more of a reddish colour; and if he continued to clean the rest of the house, he might find the small zip lock bags of BRIX that your associate hid before he left. The police certainly will after the anonymous tip off. And so the scammer rots in jail for possession of an illegal substance, whilst suffering from an incurable lung disease caused by the inhalation of brick dust; whilst share prices for the Condiments Of Choice (Kentucky) continue to rise. Could revenge be any sweeter?",You have just been cheated out of $1000 for a stupid brick. How do you take revenge?,0

I personally understand that it's ment with good intent, but on someone who is suicidal and not quite in their right mind it often has the opposite effect of where it feels like you're being shoved into a corner or dumped as someone elses problem. More often than not someone suicidal wants to talk to a normal person, someone who will care or listen to them, of course I am not telling strangers that you have to be that person - I know it shouldn't be anyone elses responsibility, all I am trying to say is that if you really want to help someone or make them feel better, linking them to something else is not a great way to go about it, it's much better worked into a conversation as a suggestion on the side.

Again, I don't want to come off as a dick here - I think it's great that so many people care enough to want to encourage others to seek help, but try to keep this in mind.

When you have depression it’s like it snows every day.

Some days it’s only a couple of inches. It’s a pain in the ass, but you still make it to work, the grocery store. Sure, maybe you skip the gym or your friend’s birthday party, but it IS still snowing and who knows how bad it might get tonight. Probably better to just head home.  Your friend notices, but probably just thinks you are flaky now, or kind of an asshole.

Some days it snows a foot. You spend an hour shoveling out your driveway and are late to work. Your back and hands hurt from shoveling. You leave early because it’s really coming down out there. Your boss notices.

Some days it snows four feet. You shovel all morning but your street never gets plowed. You are not making it to work, or anywhere else for that matter. You are so sore and tired you just get back in bed. By the time you wake up, all your shoveling has filled back in with snow. Looks like your phone rang; people are wondering where you are. You don’t feel like calling them back, too tired from all the shoveling. Plus they don’t get this much snow at their house so they don’t understand why you’re still stuck at home. They just think you’re lazy or weak, although they rarely come out and say it.

Some weeks it’s a full-blown blizzard. When you open your door, it’s to a wall of snow. The power flickers, then goes out. It’s too cold to sit in the living room anymore, so you get back into bed with all your clothes on. The stove and microwave won’t work so you eat a cold Pop Tart and call that dinner. You haven’t taken a shower in three days, but how could you at this point? You’re too cold to do anything except sleep.

Sometimes people get snowed in for the winter. The cold seeps in. No communication in or out. The food runs out. What can you even do, tunnel out of a forty foot snow bank with your hands? How far away is help? Can you even get there in a blizzard? If you do, can they even help you at this point? Maybe it’s death to stay here, but it’s death to go out there too.

The thing is, when it snows all the time, you get worn all the way down. You get tired of being cold. You get tired of hurting all the time from shoveling, but if you don’t shovel on the light days, it builds up to something unmanageable on the heavy days. You resent the hell out of the snow, but it doesn’t care, it’s just a blind chemistry, an act of nature. It carries on regardless, unconcerned and unaware if it buries you or the whole world.

Also, the snow builds up in other areas, places you can’t shovel, sometimes places you can’t even see. Maybe it’s on the roof. Maybe it’s on the mountain behind the house. Sometimes, there’s an avalanche that blows the house right off its foundation and takes you with it. A veritable Act of God, nothing can be done. The neighbors say it’s a shame and they can’t understand it; he was doing so well with his shoveling.

-

I don’t know how it went down for Anthony Bourdain or Kate Spade. It seems like they got hit by the avalanche, but it could’ve been the long, slow winter. Maybe they were keeping up with their shoveling. Maybe they weren’t. Sometimes, shoveling isn’t enough anyway. It’s hard to tell from the outside, but it’s important to understand what it’s like from the inside.

I firmly believe that understanding and compassion have to be the base of effective action. It’s important to understand what depression is, how it feels, what it’s like to live with it, so you can help people both on an individual basis and a policy basis. I’m not putting heavy shit out here to make your Friday morning suck. I know it feels gross to read it, and realistically it can be unpleasant to be around it, that’s why people pull away.

I don’t have a message for people with depression like “keep shoveling."" It’s asinine.  Of course you’re going to keep shoveling the best you can, until you physically can’t, because who wants to freeze to death inside their own house? We know what the stakes are. My message is to everyone else. Grab a fucking shovel and help your neighbor. Slap a mini snow plow on the front of your truck and plow your neighborhood. Petition the city council to buy more salt trucks, so to speak.  

Depression is blind chemistry and physics, like snow. And like the weather, it is a mindless process, powerful and unpredictable with great potential for harm. But like climate change, that doesn’t mean we are helpless. If we want to stop losing so many people to this disease, it will require action at every level.

I have a very busy life, so people ask me if I regret having her, since dogs are all high maintenance. I need to walk her a few times a day, feed her, keep her entertained, clean up after her, remove dog hair from everything including myself with an unending supply of lint rollers. 

I don't regret it. I got her for one purpose that I won't tell them. Because I'm lonely. Because when I'm at my loneliest, I don't have anyone to turn to, no-one to go see, to talk to, despite my best efforts. I have her because I know if I died, something would miss me, so I can't leave her. 

I left her at the dog boarding for an extra day after getting back from a work trip, earlier this week. I found myself calling for her, and she wouldn't come. For the first time in years, I just cried. I missed her. I wanted to sit on the couch and just pet her like she always loves. Fortunately, I could just grab her the next day. But it reminded me how important she is to my mental health. 

I recently turned down a job that would have required me to move to a place where I would have even less familial and friend support. I would have been traveling most of the year, so I would have to give up my dog. I'm glad I did. I had one friend tell me to ""absolutely not take the job""; he said if I took it, he gave me 6 months before I jumped off a bridge. I can't say he would be wrong. 

I used work to redirect my loneliness over the past several years, which ended up making it worse as it alienated me from those that I was close to. And then the company abandoned me; hired someone above me that openly tells people inside and outside of the company that he's trying to fire me. I have the CEO and President behind me, so he can't touch me; they know what I did for the company, my sacrifice, my skill, my dedication and loyalty. I now have much less responsibilities, so I can relax. 

Now, I'm here, with my dog, trying to decompress from my job, make more friends, actually date girls for the first time in many years of unsuccessfully trying. Things are starting to look better.

He was 15. My dad has been abusive but my brother suffered the most from him. He was my hero. I looked up to him and wanted to be like him. He’d take the fall for me when I did something that would cause my dad to punish me. I remember that morning vividly. I got back from school the previous day and went to go hang out with him in his room but his door was locked. I kept coming back but he wouldn’t answer the door. My parents weren’t worried because my brother usually kept to himself like that. When it was time for bed I told my dad to see if he could get the door open and he told me not to bother my brother again. After my brother didn’t come down for breakfast my father broke his door and we found him hanging from the ceiling. I wish I didn’t see that. I screamed the entire time and wouldn’t left go of his hand. It felt cold and my mother had to peel me away. He left a suicide note and a hand written will. He left me his favourite book. I miss you Jeff. 

Edit: Thank you so much everyone for the love. 

Edit 2: My dad kept repeating “why Jeffery? Why? and tried to get him down from the fan. I was screaming PLEASE JEFF! and pulling his hand and when my mom couldn’t separate our hands she pulled me away. She was crying so hard. I remember kicking my legs in the air and screaming “you should have opened his door for me”

Edit 3: The book is Animal farm by George Orwell. I always carry it with me now. Whenever he’d read it to me I’d make fun of how the big words sounded funny and we’d laugh. 

There wasn’t much in his will. He left me the book and his game boy. He left my mom his wrist watch. My dad didn’t get anything in the will. 

Edit 4: Wow I woke up to a ton of supportive messages and so much love. Thank you for all your kind words. I’ve never spoken about the details before and I pray this helps someone who is struggling. To all the Jeff’s, I know it’s hard but please be strong. You don’t want to have your family calling your name and you not answering. It’s the most painful thing ever. For years I had nightmares of trying to save him but each time I’d get there too late. 

In his note he said he was really sorry and didn’t mean to hurt any of us but he just couldn’t bear the pain anymore. He said he hoped it would make my dad stop being disappointed in him and called me his best bud in the world. He told my mom he loved her and hoped she’d find the courage he didn’t have.

But 11 years ago, I was desperate enough to believe that everyone who knew me would be better off without me. I believed that the scales weighed heavily against me - that I caused more harm than good - and that if I simply didn't exist, it would make things better for everyone.

So I started counting my pills. I'd been seeking treatment for depression for five months, but nothing was working. The meds made me worse, or they made me so apathetic that I found no joy in life, or they gave me such bad side effects that I could barely stay lucid. I thought there was no way out. So I was counting my pills, trying to figure out how many would cause an overdose so I could take them, lie down in bed, and die.

I'd arranged them all nicely, counted out every single one. I'd positioned my glass of water next to them all, and I stood staring at the scene, feeling *so* overwhelmed because the intensity and duration of my suffering had been so drawn out, and it just wasn't getting better. It had been years. *Years*. A slow decline until a breakdown, and then I was in so deep I couldn't see a way out.

Then the phone rang. It was a friend of mine, a Catholic priest, who said he felt moved to call me and see how I was doing in case things were bad. I lied to him; I told him that I was fine, that I was receiving treatment and that I was hopeful that things would start looking up. But I didn't think I had any fight left in me. He told me that he believed I did, and that he hoped I could hang on awhile longer.

I hung up the phone and burst into tears - ugly, inconsolable crying, snot dripping out my nose, curled up in a ball. But my friend had planted a seed of hope. *Someone* believed in me, even if I couldn't. And I guess I felt that I owed it to him - and to my family - to try.

I managed to get an appointment at the emergency psychiatry clinic awhile later, and there I met the psychiatrist who prescribed the drug that saved my life. I got into a daily outpatient program at the hospital. I met other people who were like me, and I found myself believing in them - believing that they could fight, that they could get better, even though I didn't believe I could. Somehow, they said they believed in me, too. And so for a second time, I saw that other people believed in me, even if I didn't. And I felt again that I should try.

So I tried. I got into weekly therapy with a psychiatrist, and I was in her care for seven years. She adjusted my meds as needed and we began the long, arduous process of untangling the mess that was my mind. She never gave up on me. (I'm in a country where she doesn't make money off me. She gets a flat salary.) 

Now, it's 11 years later, and things *have* gotten better. I am better now than I ever have been. It took awhile after my rock bottom moment to find that spark of hope within myself, but I did find it, and that is what kept me going. It made me look for anything I could to keep me hanging on, and even now, it's the small things in life that keep me here. When the moon shines through my window at night and pools on my pillow. When the white blossoms on that weird bush in the backyard finally bloom for one week every year, and I can smell them on the wind. When my dog wakes up in the morning and comes to get me because he is happy I am awake. When the sun shines just right, or the wind sends petals filtering down through the trees, or the world is silent and glittery after a fresh snowfall.

I find those moments, and I ""keep"" them. I commit them to memory so that when things get bad again, I can remember what I love about this life, and remind myself to keep hanging on. 

I still get low.Two years ago, I had been fired from my job and was certain I would never become a fully functional adult and I would always have to fight tooth and nail just to exist in society. I stood on a subway platform and listened to the rattle of the trains and tried to convince myself not to jump. The tracks were hypnotising, almost. I looked up and found myself staring at a poster for suicide prevention, and the irony was not lost on me. It broke the trance. I stepped back from the yellow line and went home. I stayed.

Last month, I got slapped in the face with a bout of severe depression out of nowhere, and then my dog passed away, which made it worse. (Dogs immensely improve my mental health.) But I stayed.

You can stay, too. 

Take it day by day. For those of us with severe mental health issues, that's all we can do - take it day by day, see how we feel, see if there are any little joys we can find and savour them. You have to cultivate the ability to find them, and it might not be easy at first. (I'm a stubborn ass and was originally so intent on believing that there was nothing good in the world that it took me a couple years to learn how to look closer.) But eventually, you'll have a breakthrough. Maybe you'll see a toddler get pegged by a ball and you'll fall over laughing. Maybe you'll hear the cicadas buzz in the heat of August and remember how awesome summers felt as a kid. Maybe you'll find an indie game on Steam that has a really compelling story and you'll find that you can't WAIT to get back to it and find out what happens next. You never know.

But you can stay. Just take it day by day. And you can see what happens.

My kidneys shut down, dialysis was required. I sustained nerve damage due to cut off blood circulation and I had to learn to walk again. Couldn’t pee normally. Multiple operations were required to fix the pressure ulcer mess. I hated that I was found before I died.

Time passed by and things gradually became better. Aside from nerve pains and a partially paralysed foot I fully recovered. I found a good job, people that supported me and an environment in which I could recover. 

Bit by bit I crawled out of the dark hole. I came across someone who loved me, she became my wife and we have been happily married for 3 years. I became a dad and there are times when I’m the happiest guy in the world. I’m so extremely grateful that I made it out of the darkness alive.

My best friend, who I met in a psychiatric hospital, didn’t find his way to the light. He sunk deeper, couldn’t take it anymore and committed suicide. Unfortunately he succeeded. The world turns on but he will be 26 forever. 

It’s extremely confronting to feel how much it hurts when someone you love, sinks too deep and leaves this world. For friends and family it’s a scar that never heals. If only he had found his place in the world, it would have been different.

Whoever you are that reads this, and is sinking so deep that death seems inevitable: try to fight like you never fought before, and don’t give up. Do it for the people that love you, but more important, try to do it for your future self. 

Somewhere there is a place for you to heal, I wholeheartedly hope you will find it. Stay strong and keep going for the light.",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

They just do not know what else to do. 

Some are truly devastatingly depressed or mentally ill. But this is not uniformly true. Many many people who are suicidal are genuinely not ""mentally ill."" 

Speaking of myself a long time ago now and others I have known - there are people out there whose suicidal ideation is a ""logical"" analytic response to essentially impossible life pressures and situations and - right or wrong - it can feel very hurtful, even offensive, and unhelpful to tell them their thinking is clouded. 

I and others I have known used the same basically functional working (but very very stressed) analytic mind to **choose* not to commit suicide.  

As I moved through that place and eventually out of it, I had to hold onto the ""option"" in my mind and make the choice -- albeit increasingly more easily -- many times before it was gone. 

All that and this too - please don't turn people into messages or PSAs. Suicide is absolutely horrible - I have been affected by its aftermath more times than I care to share, very directly and less intimately as well. It is probably almost never the right thing to do (save terminal illness, etc) but its important to honor lives as more than their ending. ",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

It gets better. It genuinely does. Even when you’re in the deepest hole. But you can’t do it alone. You can’t just cover over your issues. You need to destroy them.

In Canada, you can get referred to therapists for free by your family doctor. It takes a long time, but the wait is worth it. In the meantime, tell your friends. If they’re your true friends, they’ll understand. And, if you’re like me, you’ll find out that they’re going through the same thing.

We'll call him Harry. He was a very close friend of my boyfriend's and they had big dreams about their future together as best friends. However, myself and Harry would always end up clashing (we were younger then, a lot of thinking things were more important than they were - he was also seeing a very close friend of mine and that relationship was turbulent as well, battle lines were drawn and then they weren't and then they were. We were young. I can't tell you how important it all felt at the time and now it feels so insignificant). 

Harry and I were civil a lot of the time, occasionally we weren't. We both tried hard for the sake of my boyfriend and his girlfriend/my friend to get along, and I'm happy in retrospect that we were. 

There were times when he and I would meet to ""start again"" and try and become friends, have a coffee, chat, but it didn't ever last.

Before he died I invited him to come round and play board games in a few weekends with my boyfriend and I. He replied a few days later saying he wasn't feeling well but that he would come. I talked to him about coldsores (we both got them), and then that was it. 

The following Saturday they found him. My boyfriend was inconsolable and it was so sunny outside and I couldn't understand. He phoned his friends and he said it's not good news and from his end of the phone call he kept saying through tears ""I'm not joking"", because that's all the receiver could believe. It had to be a sick joke. 

I felt incredibly uncomfortable around Harry's family. I felt an imposter for grieving when our grievances were well known. I was livid that he did this, and I felt desolate that this happened, and I felt responsible that I didn't pick up on his message. I later learned I was the only person he messaged that week. Closer friends would interrogate me and ask did I suspect anything, what did the message say, what did I say back? I felt ashamed that it never occurred to me, and I was desperately apologetic to people who asked for comfort that I couldn't give.

Friends drove from all over to go see his family, people we'd not seen since college but still had incredibly strong friendships with, and we all sat against the wall of Harry's mom's garden and smoked. We laughed a lot too. In the sunshine. Funny stories and then someone would sob and my heart would break. I was so sorry.

The nights were worse. My boyfriend was spiralling. He couldn't sleep and when he did he would jolt awake and remember and be miserable. He would cry and look at photos of the two of them and nobody went to counselling. I should have insisted. Everyone should have gone. He went eventually. As far as I know all the men went eventually. The people who went earlier fared better than the ones who waited.

Harry's brothers told them if anyone felt that way they should say something, speak to someone. They all nodded. 

I started having dreams of Harry in awful situations. The nature in which he died bled in to my nights and I would see him in all these different ways and I would be tortured. The hardest was when I dreamt he had to go and see his family, but he stopped by me first. I knew that I had to tell him to talk to someone, but as is the nature of dreams, I knew if I told him he would go and he wouldn't get to see his family again. I woke up sorry and responsible again.

I thought about Harry every day for the first two years. Every single day. It scared me that life moved on. But it didn't really because we still spoke about it in coffee shops and at the beach, we were just older.

 I thought of my own mortality a lot. I was terrified that my boyfriend would do the same thing. Every time my boyfriend went to the store I would count minutes until I was in a panic, terrified he wasn't coming back, but too afraid to tell him, in case I would plant a seed in his head. Irrational, but everything that had happened was not how it should have been.

When he would get drunk my boyfriend would become very meloncholy. There was a time by a harbour when i was out of the country and I phoned his mom. It took a long time for him to get help, and that happened when I said, after years, that i didn't know if I could do this - the fear was suffocating and his sadness was hurting me. I sound selfish, but it hurt. I would dread opening the door after work in case inside was something I didn't want to see. 

I started to think of Harry less in a sad way as the years went on. But not completely happy either. I can't tell you how much he used to aggravate me, I still feel the red hot anger of delayed adolescence when he would deliberately provoke me. I still feel the anchor sit in the sandy pit of my stomach when I remember the day he died, my world spinning in a wild orbit, and how it was so sunny and we saw a friend and drank coffee in his garden and sobbed.

I still remember how I choked at the funeral. It was the blackest sadness I've ever felt.

And I didn't even like him.

If I could see him I would beg him to get help, I'd refuse to let him out of my sight until he was safe, I would tell him that things would be ok even though he really didn't feel like it, and more than anything I would ask him how he was doing. I would listen to him and I would do anything, anything I could to prevent it.

I didn't like him and I am still so desperately sorry about his death.

I didn't even like him and I absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt would prefer him here to annoy the shit out of me. Every day, relentlessly. 

I didn't even like him and my life has felt it's been in vignette since he died. A little out of focus at the periphery, a little black around the edges.

Please seek help. It will affect so many more people than you know.

I'm manic depressive and am used to the ups and downs, but this low didn't go away. I thought I was stronger than my depression but it just kept going. After about 6 months my spouse was just barely able to hang in there and was spending a lot of time at her mother's in another town because I was just such a fucking asshole and was losing myself. Christmas night that year, wife was at her family's celebration, I sat in our guest bedroom alone and had my 9mm in my hand. I struggled and was crying and angry and a fucking nightmare was unfolding in my head. I couldn't do it though. I let my dog in and be jumped on me and was licking me and wagging his tail, so I hung out with him for a while and put the gun away. I promised my wife I would try to make the changes necessary to recover and fast forward to today, we're halfway through her pregnancy with our first! It's a boy! I'm very physically active and I have things to work towards, and now a son coming that deserves a great set of parents. My wife is incredible and she stuck with me through times where I would have left myself... She did what she could when she could, considering how much I was pushing everyone away during that time. I can never repay her for being loyal to me when I don't think I deserved loyalty, I just hope I can give her and my son the best husband and dad possible for the rest of our lives. 

Edit: at the time, I was planning to make everyone hate me so no one would miss me when I finally killed myself. It was a dark pattern that made me lose who I was. I am a different person today and I have learned to recognize the signs and not ignore my ""small lows"". I never miss a chance to tell my wife how wonderful she is.

wednesday last week was supposed to be my last day. i started taking hella pills in the morning, but i still went to school. i distanced myself from my group of friends, saying that i had a migraine. i had already said my goodbyes to them in my mind. 

i went to see my mom in the hospital afterwards. i was mentally apologizing to her about what i was about to do. 

then she sat me down and talked to me about how she was feeling. she told me that she was thankful that i was always there for her; small things like how i stayed with her the whole day during mother’s day, even though she knew that i was bored out of my mind. she told me that she was so thankful that i was around to help take care of my siblings. she told me that i was one of the pillars of her strength, and that she would always love me, no matter what. she told me that she didn’t know what she would do without me, and that my faith in her is what gives her strength everyday.

If I didn't come home one day, he'd never stop sitting by the door waiting for me. He'd never stop missing my smell and my voice. He'd never stop wishing for one more walk, one more game of chasing the laser with me, one more high-five for a treat. He'd never stop jumping to peek out the window when he heard somebody coming up the sidewalk, and letting his heart be filled with a moment's joyful hope. No matter how many times that hope was dashed, he'd never let go of it. He's kind of a doofus that way.

Anybody else in my life might eventually get over it. You can explain to them what happened and they'd at least be able to understand if not accept it. But my little brown dog would sit forever wondering why I didn't come home. And he's had a hard enough life so far. I was his only friend when he had nobody, and he was mine.

No matter what I'm going through in life, putting him through that sort of suffering is not something my soul would ever let me do. Otherwise, I probably would have done it already. 

Life is random. There's no fate. There's no karma. ""The Secret"" doesn't actually work, except for making the people who wrote those books rich. There's no magic Santa Claus in the sky making sure all the good people are blessed and the bad people are punished. Maybe God exists, but he sure doesn't interfere. I've been praying for decades for some sort of help, or at least guidance so I can help myself. No response. No answers either. For example, why did a loving God let such an abusive monster come into my mom's life when I was a kid, turning me into an emotional cripple who can't deal with any sort of stress without crumbling? Why does child abuse happen every single day in this world? No response.

So a sane person can only conclude that it's all just random. 

That can be scary. But it can also be liberating. It means that the sheer law of averages will save your ass at some point. It can't all be bad forever. That breaks the laws of the universe. At some point something randomly good will happen. The scales will eventually balance. There's no intelligence behind it. It's just chaos that's part good and part bad. Accept it. Fighting it won't change anything.

One thing's for sure, though. Those who are prepared for the random things that come their way will have a better time dealing with them. Sit exactly on the middle line between optimism and pessimism. Prepare for emergencies so that they don't destroy you, and enjoy the good things to the fullest when they do come. But overall, just wait and watch, knowing and accepting that nothing can be good forever, but neither can anything be bad forever. ",Suicide Prevention Megathread,1

Or even when you do tell them you are having issues, and they shrug it off because they aren't in your place and they can't understand. What do you do? Nothing, you're alone.

I was depressed for a little over a year, and that year felt like an eternity. I felt like a prisoner in my own mind. Depression feels like.. being stuck in a dark, cramped, windowless room. You can't see anything, you can't move, you're suffocating. You're panicking. There are people on the outside telling you that they will figure out a way to get you out. That they are with you. But in truth they have no idea what to do and you're not even sure if they are trying, or if they even care.  

People who care will actually do something about it. They will drag you out of bed, kicking and screaming to get you to a hospital, or a mental institute, or a appointment with a therapist, or psychologist. And the only reason I ever got better was because someone physically forced me to leave my house and see a doctor. And even after being denied and confused about where to find help, he spent the entire day with me, driving around town to different hospital locations to find me a psychologist. Because that's what good friends fucking do. So stop telling people that you are there just to talk, and instead actually take action to help them. People who have depression are so enclosed within their room that they can't reach out to people, and that is why people are dying from suicide.

One of my earliest memories was finding my mum crying in her bedroom holding a noose that she had found in the loft. (I didn't understand at the time). It took me a long time to realise that - actually, its not normal for a parent to drink themselves into oblivion and take a handful of drugs or slit their wrists! He was later diagnosed with bipolar. 

Fast forward when I was a teenager my parents had split up, dad was steeply declining in his mental health, still drinking heavily. Still attempting/threatening suicide almost weekly.
He would attempt to run into walls with knives against his stomach until I'd grab him, constantly overdose. Cut himself.

My mum then remarried. I always felt a responsibility to keep my dad happy and safe so left my mums wedding early to meet my dad to make sure he was holding up OK. Of course we met in the pub, still in my bridesmaid dress, my dad walked over to me very wobbly - I assumed he was drunk. He flopped his arm around me and told me he was going to get another drink as he walked away my dress was completely covered in blood  across my waist. He had slit his wrist in a zig zag from inner elbow to his hand.
I told the barman what had happened, walked out the door, burst into tears and ran 2 miles home.
At this stage I had completely had enough, I remember vividly thinking ""I just wish he would get it over and done with so I don't have to deal with it!""
 But still I went up every day to make sure he was eating, taking his meds and generally keeping him company. 
At 15 I hadn't been up in around a week, my best friend and I had planned a girls night around our mutual friends house and popped in to see my dad on the way over. 
As soon as I walked into the communal corridor I smelt it. I knew. 
Found him led on his living room floor, flat on his back with his eyes open. Flies crawling on his arms. 
Called for an ambulance (silly - I know, I was 15 and thought they could save him) 
I don't think anyone realises the physical pain of being told ""I'm sorry he's been gone for some time, there's nothing we can do) until they go through it, it feels like a knife to the chest. 
The aftermath of so many 'I didn't think he would ever actually do it's' was astounding. 

Please, if ever somebody tells you somebody self harms for attention, take them damn seriously. There are only so many cries of help people can give!

No one saw it coming. This is someone who had a very bright future ahead of him. He was all set to take over the family business. He was a quarter back in high school and also rode dirt bikes, and he was really good at both. He loved to fish and hunt, he was passionate about a lot of things in life, especially his 2 year old daughter. He had a beautiful and infectious smile. Anyway, he caught his girlfriend cheating on him one night, and apparently she was sending him pictures of her with the guy. He was heartbroken. They had a baby together, and lived together. I remember him telling me all he wanted was his family back. She moved out and shortly after he saw her at a bar with her new boyfriend, the bar where both my step sister and step brother worked and one that she knew my brother frequented. Why she chose to go to that bar with him is beyond me. My brother got shitfaced and showed up at her new apartment. He pointed the gun at her new boyfriend and when his ex got on the phone with the police, he turned it on himself. I remember vividly going over there two day after to pick up my niece, and the blood stain was still there in the breezeway. 

My dad got a knock on his door at 3am, it was two state troopers telling him his only son was gone. I remember the phone call, my sister telling me he shot himself, and it didn’t even fully register. All I could do was mutter “is he alive?”. I remember sitting around my kitchen table with my family, all of us just quietly crying. My dad almost sold his boat because they would fish together, and it was too painful to take it out anymore. I’m happy to say that 8 years later my dad just went to Lake Erie, by himself, and he said he felt like my brother was on the lake with him. It almost gets harder as time goes on because you start to remember less and less about them, and the memories are all you have. My niece is the spitting image of him, having her around is like having a piece of him with us, she’s very special to us! 

What his suicide did to me personally is a whole different story. He was my best friend, and after he died I went down a very dark path. I self medicated and became addicted. At one point the only thing that was keeping me from hanging myself from a pipe in my basement was that I couldn’t imagine putting my dad through the pain of losing another child. The following 5 years after his death I put my family through hell all over again, i was still alive but actively trying to kill myself with drugs. I have been sober for 4 years, have a beautiful son now, and I am set to graduate college this December. Life is pretty good! We miss him every day and the pain of losing him will never go away, but where there is life, there is hope. There is never someone who is too far gone or that can’t turn things around, I am proof. The only reason I’m still here is because I finally surrendered, and got the help I needed. I wish my brother had done the same. None of us had any idea what he was going through mentally.

This might be true for someone who suffers from situational depression. The depression that goes away.

For someone with chronic depression it never truly goes away. It is not a temporary problem. It can be managed. You can be better. You can learn to live almost normally. 

But when a person has been suffering for years, barely living, barely able to get out of bed most morning, it's not a temporary problem.

When I was in my worst depressed state and I heard that saying for the first time, what I heard was: ""It's a permanent solution to a permanent problem"" And you know what? That was comforting. It was encouraging in the wrong way. I wanted to just cease to exist. Not have to worry about waking up the next morning. 

What got me through was knowing that I would destroy my children's lives. I knew they would blame themselves. Even if I thought they were better off without me there and that I was damaging them. If I took my life it would be much worse for them.

I started therapy. And that was the hardest thing I have ever done. Just finding a therapist was way harder than it should have been. I decided to show my kids that even though I was damaged and broken I could be strong.

I started being selfish in a good way. I started taking care of myself. If I couldn't get out of bed one day I didn't. I only did the bare minimum of what needed to be done. I dropped the kids off at school and came home and slept or just watched tv. I picked up the kids from school and ordered pizza.

But I only gave myself one day. My therapist called it my isolation day. The next morning I got up. I set goals for my self. One a week. Something simple. When I accomplished that goal I celebrated. Then set a new one for the next week.

My first goal was just going to the hardware store and picking out the paint for a furniture refab I wanted to do. When I say my therapist next I showed her a picture of my finished project. She was so proud of me she hugged me.

It's been a long hard journey and it will never end but I have learned to find joy in my life. I will never be cured and I will always have bad episodes but that's ok. I know they will end and I can get back to living.

There's an organization called ""Always keep fighting"" I've chosen to live by those words. When things are bad I take a sharpie and under my watch band write the letters AKF. I can just look at it remember that I am strong and I can get through this.",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

The...temptation of suicide is ever present once it's blossomed, I think. The idea abates but lingers, biding its time. You can still have so many things to be happy for, so many things to be Pollyanna-GLAD about, and still, the sticky sweet singsong of, ""but you could be done. You could be over it and not struggling any more. You could REST."" chirps persistently in your ear. 

Many times friends say, ""come, talk to me when you feel this way."" Therapists ask you to be open with them - ""are you feeling suicidal right now?"" At first, you want to trust them. But - almost always - with friends, you end up having to reassure THEM that you aren't going to ACTUALLY go through with it. The emotional toll of reassuring someone else when you are already feeling drained and fragile is a lodestone around the neck, cement shoes on a river during the first freeze. And therapists, bless their hearts (and I do mean that in the very Southernist way I can manage), tend to react and report you rather than listening. 

Say you end up in the hospital because you chose to check yourself in instead of follow through with your plan. You may also - as low income - end up in a facility with heavy drug users and addicts and other lost little puppies such as yourself, and you'll get so heavily medicated you walk around in an apathetic fog, still struggling to breath in enough air to not die in a way that feels more like murder. Group therapy will become the bane of your existence. ""Here, rip open your wounds in the company of strangers. You're safe here!"" a perky fresh-out-of-college or drained dead-around-the-eyes doctor will say. Nurses chat cherrily with patients. ""Oh, you'll be back! They always are."" 

So you withdraw more. You tuck away the horror you feel at the prospect of trudging through more struggles, bill roulette and day after day, week after week, of trudging through the motions at work. You hide your loneliness,  which at times threatens to overwhelm you with a black tidal wave of nothingness, under a veneer of cheerfulness and compassion and empathy. You learn to make your smile reach your eyes and body language when you want to weep for how much you long to be able to hold out your arms to someone - anyone - and say, ""help me! I just want to belong, to fit in, to have a place that feels like the Home I've read of in the stories."" But you can't, and so you go about your days smiling but still hearing the quiet weeping of a small child tucked into a corner in the back room of your mind. 

And sometimes the weeping abates, and sometimes the beauty and joy around you slip in, like glorious little snapshots in a world full of dark gray. And you feel content. Warm, even. Happiness. And then, not right away, but eventually the crying of the small child is audible again. And you have to play the game of, ""reasons - what reasons do I have to stay. What reasons do I have that prevent me from leaving."" 

Yeah. Suicide can be seen as selfish. You like to think you own a piece of those who you love just as you give pieces of yourself to them to cherish as well. But sometimes - sometimes - on the days and nights when the weeping is the loudest, an inky black ocean of sorrow lapping at your feet as the tide threatens to come up and fully overwhelm you at last, as the storm clouds in your mind darken, and the apathy threatens to steal your very last sliver of breath from your very lips, then yes. I can understand - much better than I ever wished to - why the siren song of suicide could overcome a person, no matter how hard they tried to fight it. 

And hopefully, HOPEFULLY, if you didn't before, you can now too. ",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

I can’t imagine leaving my pets behind and when I get emotionally distressed I go over and pet them in silence and it helps me calm down a little more and straighten myself out.  It’s hard, but it’s something.      Therapy helped me and my family open up to each other about things that I kept in that caused me to go over the edge.

We were in a city in West India far away from our hometown in the south. My parents were having troubles in their marriage and my Dad would head over to the factory and work twelve hour shifts.

I remember her crying a lot and feeling alone. I remember her striking a matchstick and pouring kerosene over her body. I remember crying and asking her to stop and then trying to fill a bucket of water in vain hoping to douse the flames that would soon engulf the apartment. 

I managed to get out of the house and I took my little sister with me. The man living below our house came up to see what the commotion was all about and he made me promise to only tell the police that it was just an accident so that my Dad wouldn't be investigated or kept in jail for a long while.

My grandmother practically brought me up and I resented my Dad and my sister for a long time. Even as we moved countries and my life improved materially, I would frequently break into fights with my Dad and I barely interacted with my stepmom.

Yeah, we’re all in debt up to our eyeballs, we all work crazy work hours for well under what we’re worth, we’re constantly bombarded by 24/7 media stimuli, but at least people in the past had their community to rely on when life went to shit.

I know the intentions are the best, but posting numbers to a suicide hotline and saying “go find someone to talk to” are kind of the equivalent of “thoughts and prayers” after a tragedy. I think we really need to re-evaluate the direction our culture is moving.",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

I had a date planned, I had a method, I had things I wanted to do and I had done it all, I had even practiced what I wanted my note to be, I had a glorious vision of people coming back to the area for my funeral and getting together again to have a good time. 

That’s when I realized I was being delusional, no one coming to my funeral would be having a good time. They would all be miserable. The note wouldn’t explain it well enough, no matter how many times I rewrote it in my head I couldn’t get it so that people would understand. My mother, she would never understand, ever. 

So, I thought about it. Most of the shit I’m worried about, it’s just shit I’m worried about. If I just stopped caring about it, it would no longer be shit I’m worried about. I mean killing myself is the end, There is nothing worse that can happen to you at that point, the game is over. Maybe I just needed to start a new game, one where I was free from the shit holding me down in this one. 

I decided I would try one more time. I’ve already lost this life. I’m here, about to kill myself tomorrow, I’ve lost, but I can start a new game, one more fucking try. This way I can restart my life without ruining the lives of others. I mean me taking my life would ruin the lives of so many around me. I can’t do that, I just want to end mine. 

So I did, I ended it by deciding to try again cause fuck it, what worse thing could I do that I haven’t already done? The only thing is kill myself, so if I don’t do that, this new life will be better than the last one. I decided to play the game, one more time. 

Since then I still think about suicide, but not multiple times a day. I don’t harp on it and dream everyone would be better off without me, cause they wouldn’t. My parents would be crushed. My siblings would be crushed. I would have traded my broken ass self for breaking a piece in each of them. 

So anyway, one more time, can’t hurt any more than it did this time right? One more time, and if I fuck up this one, it will probably be one more time again. ",Suicide Prevention Megathread,1

So I bandaged up, cleaned up, and went to lay down to re-evaluate my life. Probably should have had stitches but I wasn't ready to admit I had ""problems"".

Saying he was my godfather just doesn't do it justice. He was more like an older brother to me while he was my parent age he watched me grow and acted like a kid, he loved to just come over to my house and sit down in my room for hours keeping me company and playing games with me. He marveled at the new technology that came out and how video games were evolving. And whenever he would come over when I was with friends we would all run I say hi to him and jump to give him hugs.

I have a very vivid memory of showing him super MARIO galaxy when it came out and playing on the world with the water bowl and swinging in circles on a vine. He thought it was the coolest thing in the world replying ""Wow. This is wild."" He seemed to be the only adult in my life that still wanted to keep up on what I was interested in.

Flash forward to 2013 where I'm a junior in high school. I'm having my issues with my mom and he's been around the house a lot as he's been feeling down. I enjoyed having him here. Made the house feel more alive and he was someone I could talk to when frustrated. I wish I had known how much pain he was in, I wish I asked him how he was doing. I was not ignorant to his depression but I did not know it's extent.

One day I am in my room on my bed and my mother walks to the door. I already knew what she was going to say. She was crying, I knew what had happened. My mother and he were very close and during this time I became a support for my mother as well as my other family members. I was so worried about them that I feel I barely processed his death even to this day.

At his funeral I knew that I had to speak, he was the closest thing to an older brother I had and I wanted to say that I loved him. When I spoke everyone knew who I was. I didn't know how, but I came to find out that he had told all of the people in his life who I was, how I was growing, and the person I was turning into. It was too much for me to handle and for the first time since finding out about his death I cried. I cried through the words I spoke about how I wish he knew how much I enjoyed hanging out with him, how much I loved spending my birthdays with him or walking through rivers together. I wish I had given him a call to tell him that I loved him.

I foresee that debt in the form of paying for a service to try and make me feel better or even the cost of depresssion medication. Then god only knows what side effects would come with that, etc.

I feel trapped most of the time. I owe more than my salary in student loans, which means I’ll likely never be able to marry or own a home or really make any decision at all that is bigger than buying a video game or two.

Video games for me are an escape, while playing I don't think about anything else and time just go by fast.

Adding to that tragedy, she was several months pregnant. An emergency c-section was done at the scene (she ran her car into a tree at ~90mph) and the baby ended up dying a few hours later. I didn't cope. Not as in I didn't cope well, I simply didn't. I drank a lot. I got into a lot of really unhealthy relationships. I took a lot of risks of all sorts. Finally around 27 I decided to talk to a professional to deal with the grief. The woulds still felt fresh after all that time.

I also have depression. Bipolar II and major depression that lasts for months, if not more than a year sometimes. In 2012 I was ready to take my own life. Meticulous planning was made to ensure success and I had all of my affairs in order (closing internet accounts, letters written, a sheet printed for my wife for my online financial and insurance accounts, etc). I sat in my car for a long time when I was going to do it. I thought about my wife and my father, the two people that it would effect the most. I know what living through losing a loved one to suicide is like.

I called the therapist that I was working with and he had me come in. I tend to avoid talking about some things, so I handed her one of the letters. She called in the supervising psychiatrist for that office and he pulled a lot of strings to get me a bed at McClean Hospital near Boston. I said that I'd go the next morning because I wanted to pack a few things before heading up there. He looked at me and said I can go voluntarily tonight, or involuntarily; either way, I was going that night.

My wife was called to take me to the hospital. I'll never forget the sheer look of pain and helplessness on her face. She's the strongest person I know and I've seen her hold her shit together if horrific situations, but she just broke down sobbing uncontrollably. She didn't know I was that bad off. Neither did anyone else. It's easier to put on the act, and I was good at acting happy. I feel tremendously guilty for causing her so much pain even to this day.

My plans were so detailed, so foolproof that it was just a matter of counting down the days, mainly because I wanted to get past my Kid's 5th birthday on 5/18 (for a final photo-op for her) and then make it out before the middle of June.  Starting from March '17, it was such a bleak time that I couldn't see past June. It was a wall that I was speeding towards and I didn't have any brakes and the fear and panic of living were consuming me so much that I just drowned in depression. 

I made my rounds, had my 'final' moments with friends (they didn't know) and then had a final talk with my therapist. All of this between May 28th and the first week of June. The closer it got to the end of the first week in June, the calmer I became, knowing it would be all over. I'd finally be at peace

Then in one unidentifiable moment, it all changed. Suddenly there was no impending doom. I made it into the second week, and then the third week of June and while I still was depressed, it wasn't this end-all-be-all ultimatum that my brain concocted. The days came and went one at a time and I was still around. 

Here I am, almost a year to the day of my scheduled demise, and I can't fathom how on earth I could have left my wife and daughter alone. I've had so many great moments and made so many memories that now I have a crippling fear of dying. 

The pendulum has swung. I called my brother from another mother and I mentioned this to my last visit with my therapist: Suicidal thoughts, when it's occurring, seems like the only possible way out - once you pass that threshold (if you can) you'll see that it was a terrible, horrible trick of the mind (sorry, it's the only way I can explain it.)

If you're suicidal, let someone know. If you're depressed, get into some CBT classes, or therapy groups, tell your story, listen to others and realize that you're not alone and that your problem isn't as bad as those other people's. Someone always has it worse than you and they're still around - fighting. 

Waking up out of that fog is such a ""lost in a forest' feeling that you spend some time feeling your way around living. Then you realize that after a fair amount of time passes by that suicide

I'm fortunate that my wife has a good health plan that affords me to go to a great therapist. I know others don't have that luxury. If you're one of the other, there are resources online, support chat room, even walk-in clinics. Just ask someone, go to the ER if you have to and just ASK. 

Fight to live. Battles are hard fought, but make sure you are armed to win the war on life.  Help is out there, you just have to realize you need it and accept it.

Be strong. Keep Living.

First of all id like to say im better now  ( ive been listening to Powerwold , Dethklok and metallica all day so that helps) so heres the basic jist of it I failed one of my finals , and even if I pass the other two I have to wait until August to retake it which probably means I wont get into the collage of my choice hooray, so id have to wait a year before  doing it , basically waste a year, I felt so shit about failing that I didnt eat or drink anything all day ( and considering it was 30+ degrees outside well says something) I felt so disappointed in myself that I failed just so shit , my dad was disappointed and was like "" wtf can I even tell you youre not your brother you understand what happened so see you can do , you should've went to school to see if you can fix it "" which  is reasonable , an hour or so later I pick up a bagels to eat , like rather small ones  so I eat one and take a bite out of the other and my mum walk in . Now before I continue I love my mother but shes just .... how can I describe it think of Lois from malcom in the middle but more neurotic,like the day I dont have to fear her screaming at me its gonna be fucking Nirvana , ill probably emulate Corpsegrinders Vermilion scream. Anyway she walks in and askes me "" Are you fucking insane  , do you realize that literally no one failed their finals in 40 years youre literally the only idiot who failed "" ( im not 3 people in my class  alone failed) "" How could you  fail ?!  Do you realize how embarrassed I am that you failed , what am I supposed to tell.everyone when they ask me about you! ""  now I try to tell her that I feel fucking horrid that I just wanna die all day  , and her response is basically "" HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL I HAVENT EATEN OR DRANK ANYTHING ALL DAY "" and insert  like a solid minute of yelling before I broke down in tears in front of her to which she responds "" STOP ACTING LIKE A NINE YEAR OLD  TAKE RESPONSIBILITY ARE YOU GONNA CRY WHEN YOU MAKE A GIRL PREGNANT TOMORROW"" and im just historically sobbing and she leaves to prepare for the gym while still yelling at me and I ask her "" please just leave me alone  "" I repeated that a few times and her response was "" OR WHAT YOURE GONNA HIT ME "" ( I have never raised my hand on any of my family with the intent to hurt , I have never hit my mom or dad nor intended or tried to the most ive gotten I playful fighting with my dad when I was younger , ill hit anyone who has intent to hurt me or kill me but I will not hit someone out of the blue, the last time I was in a fight was 5 years ago against my bully)and im just sobbing on the kitchen counter ans tell her ,that in not gonna hit her ,im not threatening her or anything simply asking her to stop, my dad walks in talks to me a bit and gives me honey and some water saying."" Take some honey and water youll get a fucking stroke"" so I pick up the spoon my hand is shaking like so much its insane and I drink the water ( my first water today!) And try to calm down  and before my mum goes to the gym she comes she comes to talk to me again"" I dont know what your problem with me is ,but I have your best interest in mind,and you're an addict to your phone, you have a problem you're an addict all you do is play games all day, you should've studied more , and prepared more instead of palying games "" at which point what am I supposed to say , anythinf denying is just gonna confirm it in her mind and I just tell her take me to the therapist if you think that's true snd she just packs and leaves 




In hindsight I should've studied and the fact that I failed is 150% on me , I felt confident enough that I could pass the same 5 subjects that ive been studying for 4 years , I have seemingly been proven wrong , that is no ones failure but my own , I can make excuses as to why it happened such as me.being scared shitless because the first two questions were something ive never seen , but even then that's on me . On the other hand I dont think calling me an addict is something adequate  , I have 4 games on my phone and.play 1,5 of them ( probably more but I fire up the GBA emulator once ina blue moon sooo) I really am not doing anything most of my time is spent reading , manga and books , sometimes comics ! And talking to my gf and friends ( of course take everything I say with a grain of salt since youre getting my perspective only and I might be terribly wrong with out realization) , I genuinely dont believe im too attached to my phone , if I had the ability to talk to my friends and gf another way that was just as accessible I do it ffs man I have messager installed  but not FB , I genuinely dont need it beyond updates for my school ,I literally use the easiest and cheapest way to talk to the people I like . For Christ's sake I regularly leave my phone behind when I go to my grannies and I dont have a second thought about , the thing I have on my mind is getting two.whiny old ladies of my back , but whatever maybe im just proving her point that im an addict by ranting so much about it so like who I have no idea 


And for the epilogue  : Twilight of the thunder god is an amazing Amon Amarth album


Anyway shout out to everyone here who cares to message me , leave a kind comment or show their care , and shout out to my  probably best friend for cheering me up and getting chocolate ice cream over her white dress , youre the real MVP youll be an amazing doctor <3",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

Then the day after Thanksgiving, 2016, I moved 5 hours away from my family and fiancée to take a job at a tv station.

The town was depressing in and of itself, with some of the highest heroin overdose and poverty rates in the state. Couple that with a shitty work situation and being just 23, I hit rock bottom.

I was keeping it mostly under control, and actually started seeing a therapist who helped quite a bit. But one day came where it was too much, and I was so stressed and broken from the thought of having to go to work and throw myself into a job that was so draining that I decided I was going to drive myself into a tree on the way over. I never self-harmed, I still could laugh and joke with friends, but I simply didn’t see the point of going on any longer.

While I didn’t tell my fiancée, she could tell something was wrong, and called my therapist. My therapist immediately sent someone from the services over, who helped talk me down. She called into my job to tell them I wouldn’t be coming in to work that day. 

That I was thankful for enough, but it was the reactions of those around me that moved me. When he heard what happened, my roommate (who worked at the same station and whom I had only met a few months before) rushed home immediately to make sure I was okay.

That night, my fiancée drove five hours in a snow storm to get to me, and spent a week with me, and got to meet my coworkers.

I ended up leaving the job two months or so later - a year ago since this past Tuesday. I moved back home with my parents for a few months, and now I’m back in the town where I went to college, working as an admissions counselor for my alma mater.

I married my wife last December, and she has been my saving grace. She is lovely, and funny, and smart, and so much more than I can ever hope to be. I entirely credit her with saving my life, and I never can tell her enough how much I love her.

People care about you. You just have to let them in.",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

One guy posted asking us, “My DM recently died from suicide, please put him in your games.” So I did. I was wtiting a short game at the time and I named it after this other DM. 
But I went a step further and I designed a dungeon whose every aspect, every chamber, represented a different mental illness or a mental health challenge. From the kobolds in my village being shunned (the way some people with mental illness are shunned) to the first room needing to be completed in a certain pattern (to represent OCD) to having my players run through a room full of traps (to represent the long, tedious, full-of-bullshit path some people must walk to even access mental health services), it was all about mental health. 

I named almost every NPC after classmates/friends I’ve lost to suicide, and simply remembering these people, some for the first time in years, brought tears to my eyes. Siro and Colleen and Nat and Julian and Preston and Nick and more.

If I could talk to them again, I’d say “Even if we barely knew each other, if you get another go-around and you have these troubles again, come find me and I will listen.” And to all of you now who need it I say PM me and I’ll listen. 

I will not report you to the cops or to mental health professionals who’ll just hold you and then slap you with a hospital bill you cannot repay.

I am not a licensed mental health professional.

I HAVE done mental health first aid training.

Nobody is going to read this since i'm so late  to the post but here it is anyways. I'm sick of having borderline personality disorder. I'm sick of my identity shifting from one day to the next. I'm sick of not being able to follow through with anything. I'm sick of being able to sleep for 24 plus hours straight. I'm sick of people who live full lives and who have never suffered  from mental illness telling me it's going to get better. Because it really hasn't. And even if it does for a little bit it's just going to get worse again. The lows make my life. The highs are extremely rare. There is no neutral. There is no middle of the road. 

Sometimes I think it's my right to take my own life. I'm the one who has to live it and I honestly don't want to anymore. 

This post is a nice gesture, but in my opinion, I actually think it's near impossible to tell when somebody is truly planning suicide. That's why news like this hit us like a ton of bricks. ",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

I remember being like 6 and telling my mom I wanted to be dead and didn’t really want to be here anymore. She told me that life is full of ups and downs and that I should never want to give up and then I remember her saying that once you’re gone, there is no coming back, people will cry and will be heart broken, they will always remember you but they will have to continue with their lives and move on. It was a dark reality as a child bot knowing why was scary. I was suicidal for years, not caring about myself. I had a pistol in my mouth more than I’d like to admit. I was the most fun guy at all the parties but dying inside. Sometimes cutting myself to feel something. 
Then it happened, a few years after high school my best friend, after being accepted at a big 10 college and getting scholarships, he washed his truck, cleaned his room and went and bought a box of hunting shells and blew his head off in a park a few miles from his house. No reason. No note. After They police asked if I knew who’s phone number was in his pocket. It was my new cell number. I was devastated and confused,hurt, mad and just sad. I still, to this day would will never forget that he could have just called me and talked. My depression got worse through out the years after loosing both my parents to cancer and my sister to an overdose 3 years ago. BUT I WILL NEVER GIVE UP. I WILL NEVER DO THAT WHICH WAS DONE TO ME.

Date and time picked out and everything.  I was in a place so dark that even the concept of light and joy were inconceivable to me. 

I was absolutely and utterly convinced that my family was going to be better off without me. That the world would be better off without me. If I had known a way to go back in time to ensure I had never existed I would have. 

My grandmother told me from a very young age that my birth was a mistake and that I was unwanted.  She told me I was unlovable and that if anyone ever told me they loved me it would be to use me.  This is something i still struggle with now even knowing it is absolute bullshit.  

I then reported my grandfather, her husband, for sexual and physical abuse at the age of 14.  I never lied about this or anything else that happened. I know now that this was the right choice. However, it tore my family and my world apart at that time.  My parents were great and supportive.  My father was absolutely crushed that his father was doing what he was. My mother was distraught that she had missed the signs. My grandmother called me an attention seeking whore and told anyone who would listen that I was a slut who had seduced him.  

Aunts and uncles tore me apart for airing family business and not allowing family to take care of it.  My brother was too young to understand what was going on and was very close to the grandparents so he believed my grandmother when she said I lied about all of it. 

I was 19 yrs old and planned to die on my 20th birthday. Figured it would save my parents some money if they got a head stone with fewer characters to engrave. 

I was killing a lot of time on the internet, chatting with strangers, taking stupid quizzes etc when I met a stranger who lived 3000 miles away from me through one of those quizzes. We started talking.  He asked how I was and how my days were, what I had done and what my plans were.  

A complete stranger took an interest in what I was doing and how I was doing.  I found myself sharing my story with him and he listened without judgment. I told him things I hadn't told anyone else and he listened without judgment.  I was never going to meet him so it didn't matter what he said. 

These conversations started to crack the shell of darkness around me and I began to see light again.  The thought of my impending suicide didn't bring as much comfort as it once had.  These conversations changed my perspective.  I was able to see that I was not the villain or the bad guy. I was able to see the pain and anguish these 5 years had put my parents and sister through. I could suddenly see the fear and anger and hatred (towards herself and her husband) that drove my grandmother's narrative.  

I should be clear that my immediate family were checking on me and were worried about me. They were expressing interest and concern but I couldn't see it. My depression was too deep. I know it would have caused a lot of pain and sorrow had I died then but in that place I couldn't see that. I thought my death would bring relief and peace.  I know better now.  

I met that internet stranger 4 months after we started communicating online. Married him 6 months after that. We're still married and have a 15 year old son.  Life isn't always easy and it would be a lie to say that suicide never occurred to me now. There are moments when I'm driving home and I think how easy it would be to drive off the road. I don't actually want to and wouldn't follow through but it happens. 

If you are still reading this, I guess my message is to reach out to strangers. Say hello. Ask them how they are and mean it. Be willing to be a friend or a shoulder if you find someone in need.  You never know if your hello will be the crack in their shell that lets the light back in.  I chose life because of a stranger's kindness. 

TL:DR: I planned to commit suicide on my 20th birthday due to some fucked up events in my life and terrible self image. An internet stranger asked me how I was doing and meant it. Saved my life. Now he's stuck with me. I chose life. Hardest choice of my life but I'm so glad I made the choice I did. ",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

It has really unbalanced my life. I don't ""blame"" him because he was emotionally unstable and mostly I feel sad he was so miserable that suicide was his only option. But I missed out on getting to know him and his sense of humor and his skills. There's so much I think we could have shared. I have a void where he could be. 

There's so much mental illness in my family. Dealing with my own has taught me that the biggest hurdle to getting help is often yourself. (There are often financial and access issues, too, I don't want to dismiss that.) 

I felt too guilty to reach out for so long.  I had my plan firmly in place. I was so lucky there were resources available to me. All I had to do was call my county crisis services. I wasn't shamed for reaching out. There are people who can help you feel like there is color in the world again. 

My life is so wonderful now. I've been able to come back from my lowest point and carve out a little slice of paradise for myself. I have gained so much for choosing to get help. ",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

Start every day with 10 mins of meditation and it will help bundles in calming you down and allowing you to think rationally throughout the day. 

&nbsp;

EDIT: Well this blew up. My inbox is going crazy. Two things:

1) Yes, it's tough to start off with 10 mins of meditation. My point was that 10 mins is more than enough, so if you target that to be your ceiling, that's all you need. But meditation is ridiculously tough and much harder than people actually think it is, so as others have recommended, starting off with 2-3 mins and then building up isn't a bad idea.

2) I can definitely see people falling asleep during meditation. And initially, that's not even a bad thing because the whole point of it is calmness and clarity of thoughts. But if you push yourself a little bit consciously, you can maintain that clarity of thought even while you stay awake and keep yourself aware. Remember, inhale (1) and then breathe out (2). Then 3, 4, then 5, 6. Keep counting so that your attention is on your breathing and you will have a difficult time falling asleep but an easier time from there on focusing on something.

What this looks like is neck craning forward, slouching shoulders, belly sticking out, butt sticking out. Think of an S curve, you head is forward, shoulders back, belly forward, butt is back.

This will lead to back, knee, neck, shoulder, hip, elbow, even ankle pain. Basically, everywhere that can hurt may. 

Correcting this isn't incredible difficult and it takes about 30 minutes a day of light exercise and stretching followed by consistent use of good posture, when you nail it, you'll breath better and feel better overall. 

The #1 key is to learn to activate your glute muscles, best way to do this is to do glute-centric motions without weight so you can focus on exploring pathways that activate the muscle. This includes squats, good-mornings, glute bridges, and kick-backs. 

From here the other strengthening exercises are for the upper back, and the core. 

Prone cobras for the upper back, look up the position on google, very simple. Hold for 30-60 seconds, release. This is endurance training, aim for 3-5 ""reps"" of 60 seconds or so.

Next is planks. No cheating, make sure your tummy is tucked in and not drooping or you're not doing yourself any favors. 

After this, we want to do some simple stretching - Look up the ""Warrior Pose."" This will stretch your hip flexors and quads. This pull your hips down, while your abs pull up. We want the abs to win this fight, so stretch the quads, strengthen the abs. 

But stretching is the least important, most important is activation of the glutes, followed by developing a sense of how good posture 'feels' so you can return to it without a mirror.  ",What’s something small you can start doing today to better yourself?,0
