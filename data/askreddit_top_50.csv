I had the pleasure of working under him for some pop culture conventions and all he wanted was to see fans smile and enjoy his legacy.  He loved to joke with those around him, and he would tease the ever loving hell out of everyone he could.  

I remember him using his motorised scooter to get around backstage and his poor assistant would speed walk to keep up with him, but he would just keep increasing the speed until she was running beside him. A wicked grin on his face the whole time. 

Or how he would constantly make his staff repeat themselves ""what I didn't hear you!"" Untill they had repeated themselves four times, witnessing that initially made me sad, thinking his hearing was poor, until he looks at me with that same grin and winks.  

My time with him was short, but I'm so glad I got it, this man changed my life before I even met him, and he made a huge impact when I did as well.

Here we were, just average idiots in a place we weren’t supposed to be. 

We approached, just wanting to say hello and thank him for his work. The handlers were not having any of it and started to move us along. He stopped the handlers and said hello to us. I got to shake his hand and thank him. He asked if we had cameras. I was kinda dumb-struck by the moment, and forgot cameras existed. He actually wanted to pose for pictures with us.

Still have the photo, and a nice memory of a pretty great guy who was good to his fans.

About 4-5 years ago I was in Chicago going to school for animation.

Comicon was in town but I had to work and didn’t have the money to go anyways.

Anyways I worked at Dunken Donutes and got good with the owner so I was basically his errand boy. 

I was delivering bagels and donutes to another store on foot. I was standing at the corner of wabash and another street, forgot the name, waiting for the light so I could catch a train to another part of downtown.

Next to me was this old man with white hair and shades. I am a pretty talkative person but instead I found myself just staring at him.

He caught me staring and raised his eyebrows at me. I apologized and explained that he just looked so familiar...


He winked at me and said, “I get that a lot.”

Turned and walked away. About an hour later I found out Stan Lee was in Chicago for that Comicon and I’ve been kicking myself ever since.

He was up there with Toriyama Akira and Hayao Miyazaki for me. The people I’ve always wanted to just sit down with and drink coffee.

Spider-Man was always my favorite, because I was a weird kid and found spiders fascinating. I loved him more as I grew up, because there were so many similarities: raised in poor families beset by financial troubles. Quick with jokes to cover insecurities. A deep love of science that shaped everything I did. The implicit knowledge that I may not be the strongest, or the toughest, or the most resilient, but that I always had to stand back up. Intellectually gifted and, with it, a compulsory, driving need to use that to help people. It's why I became a scientist researching psychiatric illnesses, and then later Alzheimer's disease, because I recognized that I had a gift - and so I had a responsibility.

Spider-Man is paper and ink, but he is an ideal I always have, and always will, aspire to. He is my hero. And the man who helped give me that ideal, who shaped so much of my childhood and identity, has died, and the world is a sadder place.

I knew Stan Lee before I knew who the hell he was. He was the guy with the cool voice who narrates my spiderman game on N64 when I was a child. It wasn’t until years later that I learned it was his voice, but even before then I learned the name of Stan Lee. He helped create my favorite superhero, Spiderman. He gave my father a line of comics to pass down to me and form a closer connection between the two of us. And he created a character who taught me that I’m not powerless just because I was a kid. 



While it’s easy to write off comic books as a child’s entertainment medium, his work really did have a lasting impact on my life, and that impact has in turn helped me touch the lives of others with his works. I NEVER discuss this outside of my clinical setting, but I use the themes and tropes of Spider-Man in my practice to help clients, many of whom are not particularly intellectual, understand concepts like codependency and hero complexes. Thanks to Stan, I’m able to explain very complex ideas to my clients and help them overcome what I’ve come to call “Peter Parker Syndrome.” So, even beyond his personal impact on my own life, I owe Stan Lee a great debt. 



His is an influence that will be missed. Marvel games, movies, and media at large will simply not be the same without him. Through the act of creating superheroes, Stan Lee himself became a superhero, a household name that influenced generations of people all around the world. May he Rest In Peace, but may his legacy continue to resonate with men and women of all ages for generations to come.

Edit: since people were asking what “Peter Parker Syndrome” is, I’ll copy/paste my response here. It’s an allegory I use to illustrate certain themes:


It’s how I explain codependency and hero complex to clients. 


I started by introducing Spider-Man and his real identity. I outline to my client that, once Peter gets his powers, he goes all in on being spiderman. A running theme in the books is that spiderman is the real identity, and Peter Parker is the “disguise.” 


Anyway, Peter goes all in on being spiderman, and it starts to fuck with his life. He loses his girlfriend, drops out of school/loses his job, and loses touch with family. But he doesn’t care, because he gets to be the hero and that’s what matters most to him.


Time passes, and a villain shows up. Wipes the floor with spiderman. Then he realizes that the one thing he cares about, being the hero, he can’t even do anymore. In some storylines, he gives up and puts away the costume. Slowly but surely, he rebuilds his life. He starts dating again, re enlists in school/gets a new job, starts having hobbies again. And for the first time in a long time, Peter is happy.


Then the villain comes back. In the absence of anyone else who can help, he inevitably puts the mask back on and fights. And he wins. And what he learns (and then unlearns because the universe is reset) is that, in order to be a good spiderman, he has to be a good Peter Parker. And when Peter suffers, so does Spiderman.

I then relate the client’s self care to their “Peter Parker” and their desire to be there and care for others to their “Spiderman,” to illustrate that they cannot engage in the selfless acts they want to if they do not take care of themselves first.


A seemingly simple idea that a lot of my clients struggle to wrap their head around. I then have them keep a running tab of how Peter Parker is doing each day to find gaps in self care.",Stan Lee has passed away at 95 years old,0

I learnt more from spider-man about responsibilities then anyone.

She walks all the way up to Stan and he talks with her for a minute or two and signs the photo.

That’s where I saw Wizard magazine (#34) for the first time, which featured on its cover an illustration of Rogue and Psylocke of the X-Men. I was somewhat familiar with Batman, Spider-Man, and Superman, but I really didn’t know of any female superheroes (aside from Wonder Woman, who frankly seemed pretty lame to me as a kid) at that time. I bought the magazine, and for months, it was an obsession for me. I read it over and over again. I started buying comic books, drawing characters, reading the stories out loud in the voices I imagined each character to have, dreaming up new powers and imagining new worlds. What I loved about the Marvel universe was that there was room for everybody: men, women, people of different races, nationalities, ages, abilities, and backgrounds. It made me feel like comic books were something that everyone could enjoy. I shared my love for comic books with my brother. Although he struggled in school and teachers couldn’t get him to focus, he would pay attention when I read The Uncanny X-Men to him, and when he finally learned to read, it was because of comic books. Thanks to Stan Lee for showing us that anyone can be a hero. RIP. ",Stan Lee has passed away at 95 years old,0

He was being escorted outdoors, along the main glass hallway where all the talks were happening. It was so hot, and he was wearing his signature yellow sweater vest and keeping pace with his assistants. I couldn't believe my eyes. I was just hanging outside, and there he was, steady as he goes. I yelled at him the only thing I could, "" I LOVE YOU STAN!"".

I didn't expect him to hear me since there was a good amount of distance between us and he was hurrying to his panel (The Amazing Stan Lee). But no, with double barrel fingers towards me, not missing a beat, that firm, unmistakable Stan voice we all have grown accustomed to all these years, I hear, ""Love you too!"".
 
Many years later me and three friends go for a group photo. There was a kid before us, and Stan made sure to take time with the young boy and not let the photographs rush thier moment. 
Once our photo was taken. I noticed how smaller he was now, not weak, but small like my own grandma. Instead of thanking him, I just told him I loved him. He didn't hear me but it didn't matter. 

Out of all the stories and heros and villans he gave us, Stan was the truest hero and champion of our hearts and imaginations. 

Stan was the man. He never let us down, and in his memory I/we should try to be like Stan. Ever moving, bending, steadfast, and fighting for the future for ourselves and others in ways that we can.

First of all, he lived a long life. 95 years.

They played them over the voice over, so it was louder and actually sounded like an emergency vehicle was close. I'd gotten fooled more than I'd like to admit by it. I always checked my mirrors to see if any emergency vehicle was coming, luckily none ever did. It got to the point where I stopped listening to it all together. My view on it is that they could desensitize people to sirens ""Oh just the radio station again"" and I would assume people have blocked emergency vehicles without realizing. People already do it enough as is. I'd be happy if they removed any sounds that are meant to grab peoples' attention while driving such as sirens, horns, squealing tires, or wrecks just to name a few.

Hear me out - I discovered through therapy that I needed a mechanism for judgement-less and objective self-analysis and Mr. Spock is that dude. He can see the most fucked up space shit ever and react calmly and objectively.


Mr. Spock: ""The massive space blob has a 97.454% chance of consuming the ship and everyone inside within 4/7 minutes. Projections show it will be slow and painful.""


Kirk: ""That's horrible!""


Spock: ""Yes, it is not ideal for our continued survival, but it's actions are entirely within the nature of the space blob.""


So, whenever I get spun up on something in my head I imagine a mini-Spock in my head with a science terminal that can pull all data about ME. 


me: ""Spock, science report.""


Spock: ""Data shows that godspeedmetal is 5.8 days from quitting smoking tobacco and is under great mental distress from the change of chemical intake. He isn't consciously aware of it, but he's attempting to make up an excuse to get gas on a half-tank in order to create an opportunity to buy a pack of cigarettes.""


me: ""Thank you, Spock, sounds like I'm being dishonest with myself. I suck!""


Spock: ""I disagree. It's entirely within the nature of a nicotine addict to seek out a source of nicotine intake. This is neither Good or Bad. Just natural. Data also suggests that conscious awareness mitigates the chances of nicotine intake by 89.45%. You've yet to procure a nicotine source as well. Commendable.""


Just going through that mental exercise will help knock me out of a mental spun-up state, help sort out emotions, feelings, all that stuff, into a parsed, objective, and most importantly, non-judgemental way.

EDIT: holy shit, I'm happy this was received as well as it was. This mechanism has helped myself so much, however I'd offer a couple of words of advice if you are intending to take on this method as well because it can be a frustrating mechanism to employ if you don't have your expectations set correctly. 

One - Spock's reports WILL be amended, appended, referenced and reworked entirely. This is all part of the process. Even Spock had several times where extended analysis was needed to understand something in order to create a way to cope/overcome/whathaveyou. Don't treat everything he says as immutable truth - his analysis is only as good as the data he is able to receive through that mental science terminal. Your initial reports will upgrade that terminal for stronger analysis in the future.

Two - You WILL fail, as well, and that's totally OK! He's analyzed far more for me than just smoking - everything from anxiety, struggles with work, and interpersonal relationships has been reviewed through that science terminal. But sticking with the smoking report as an example - recognizing that ""getting gas"" was just an excuse to get cigarettes didn't come from a single analysis, but was referenced from a prior ""science report"", as at one point I had quit smoking, went to get gas a few days later and drove away with a pack of cigs in my pocket. Spock reported, ""godspeedmetal formulated a reason to create an environment that allowed his weakened will to procure a source of nicotine. Further analysis shows that nicotine addiction is extremely subversive to godspeedmetal's psyche at a subconscious level. The strength of control the addiction exerts upon his mind is quite strong. *Fascinating.*"" Spock doesn't judge me - it all is what it is - and I respond, ""That IS fascinating! My mind is stranger than I ever thought possible. However, I am more in control because I now recognize this pattern of behavior. I believe that this can be identified at a later point if I do this again. Thank you, Spock."" That failure to stop smoking at that time was an opportunity to learn about myself. And FYI - I'm several months smoke free and still going!

Three - this isn't to make someone an emotionless logic machine, either - Spock understands human nature is an emotional experience. Humans get horny, sad, happy, angry, depressed, excited - all of that stuff that comprises the human condition - it's all part of the Logic of Being Human. Take that into account, yet strive to be aware of your humanity and make conscious decisions on what you do instead of sub-consciously reacting emotionally.

Four - trust your intuition. Your instincts have been developed over millions of years of evolution. Your mind is *powerful* and can sub-consciously recognize threats and boons to your world and yourself. Even if you don't understand *why* your guts are reacting they way they are, don't dismiss it. Run it by Spock and if you don't come to a satisfactory answer, you can always revisit later when you've more experience, time, and data.","Anthony Bourdain once said ""There's a guy in my head, and all he wants to do is lay in bed all day long, smoke pot, and watch old movies and cartoons.

* Commercial Spaceflight - Its literally here right now, but its going to get even cheaper in the future. The next step will be space tourism, but that won't be accessible to the average person for a few decades at least.

* Space Construction - We've already done this with space stations, but cheaper commercial spaceflight will encourage larger buildings in space. Instead of launching completed modules like we have in the past, we're going to be launching subdivisions of modules that will dwarf even the ISS. I'm incredibly optimistic about whatever happens to be the ""next ISS"".

* Asteroid Mining - This one we probably won't see in our lifetimes, (unless the futurists are right, and the first person to live to 200 is alive today). However, the potential of asteroid mining is astronomical! There are individual asteroids with more platinum and tungsten on them than the entire Earth has available. Once we have these materials in excess, who knows what new developments we'll see. Aluminum used to be exceedingly difficult to refine and rare. Once a reliable refining process was developed, we found a myriad of uses for aluminum that changed the world. I predict we'll see similar benefits from improved access to rare metals found abundantly in asteroids.

* Space tourism - Now that we've got commercial spaceflight, and space construction is on the horizon, space tourism will become a booming industry. I'd be excited to spend a week on a luxury space station in the future. 

* Mars - We're definitely going at some point, whether it is publicly or privately funded. I doubt there are any monsters there, or that we'll have any visitors forced to grow potatoes with their excrement. However, Mars is the next logical destination for humanity's domination of the solar system. I hope I live to see the first colonization effort!","With all of the negative headlines dominating the news these days, it can be difficult to spot signs of progress.

That's easy - the past.  People live in this weird bubble of time that seems to them to encompass everything but in reality is the tiniest fraction of a drop in the bucket of human society.  We really just don't have a good sense of how *bad* things used to be, even only just a few hundred years ago.

A few examples: look how upset we get when ISIS does something horrible, like burning someone alive or murdering everyone in a village.  It's front-page news.  It's a huge outrage.  But five hundred years ago, it was *totally normal.*  It was something *governments* did, and not just now and then but as a matter of course.  ""Kill the men and enslave the women"" wasn't seen as barbarous, it was just business as usual.

Hell, let's one-up that.  Five hundred years ago in South America, motherfuckers were *eating each other* like it was something to do.  The entire continent was run by massive empires of cannabalistic slave-holders who thought about human sacrifice the way we think about American Idol.  We think about how brutal the Conquistadors were by our standards; realize that the people they pushed out of power were *even worse than that!*

Shit, look at the last century!  Communism killed a hundred million people, Nazism got a few tens of millions more, and that's before we go into all the ""minor"" genocides here and there.  We are *so much better off* than people can possibly comprehend.

Congressional members aren't paid from annual appropriations and are paid through a salary not based on hours worked, but as their status as members. More importantly, members of Congress are constitutional officers. The President (and life-tenured federal judges) is also a constitutional officer and also cannot be prevented from carrying out their duties except as allowed in the Constitution. As such, they're all constitutionally entitled to pay.

Article 1, Section 6 of the Constitution:

>The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.

27th Amendment:

>No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.

It also functionally wouldn't do much besides perhaps damage the one or two financially untenable younger members (AOC for example). The shutdown and pay being withheld impact only those employees that *need* that money imminently, which is not the vast majority of Congress and certainly not the President.

If you're making 500K selling your soul to a big corporation, than your check for being a part of congress is an after thought. Mean while freshmen senators who realistically spent nearly all of their money on campaigning to get into congress and change a broken system will be the only ones to suffer. 

So this could just help the spread of corruption against high ranking government members. Although why should they be exempt from suffering the way TSA workers or Prison workers do?

I feel that instead of stopping anyone from getting payed, if a budget isn't agreed upon, than we have an emergency 3 months airbag where we pay federal workers for those 3 months and essentially use the previous budget. If those 3 months go by and still no movement is made, then there should be repercussions for congress and the presidency. Something along the lines of an immediate replacement of all leading members of congress and a removal of the current president. This later one is dangerous because there are times that congress would be willing to kill it's self to kick a sitting president out of power, such as republicans during the Obama administration, and I suspect Democrats during the Trump administration.

Additionally congress should be forced into a minimum of 8 hour work days with the president sitting in on the meeting trying to find a compromise. There should be no vacations, time off, or excuses with the exception of terminal illness. If a member of congress fails to show up, they would effectively be removed from congress, and if the sitting President or Vice President is not there than their power to veto a budget will be removed and it would only take both houses to confirm a budget.","[Serious] Americans, would you be in support of putting a law in place that government officials, such as senators and the president, go without pay during shutdowns like this while other federal employees do?

I think people should be organ donors but it should be something they consciously decide to do, not because they didn't get around to filling out the paperwork.

Their parliament, the Althing, has been in continuous session since 986 - not 1986 - and has a rather unusual track record of keeping the interests of Icelanders at the forefront of its decisions.  Every Icelander's DNA is stored at a central repository and companies like decode Genetics have access to this DNA; along with Iceland's unique patronymic/matronymic naming system and the records of the Althing, many avenues of research, from the geneaologic to the medical, are available.  The Althing granted broad consent for this work in the early 2000s and although individual Icelanders may opt out only a few dozen had done so the last time I looked into it.

I think Iceland's relative cultural homogeneity, its small population, and its position as the only society inhabiting a place that is rather forbidding 6 months out of the year has something to do with making this possible.

About ten years ago my mother at age 69 had a massive stroke. They didn't expect her to live let alone come out of it mostly alright. Which she did except for some vision loss in her left eye. (Not total, just peripheral.) So she can only see perfectly straight out of that eye.

So after about a year recovering from the stroke and the ensuing infection from the surgery that ended up being worse then the stroke itself she decides she wants to go get tested to see if she can retain her drivers license. (Required by law in my province of Canada).

My father was not well either as he had a long term terminal illness so I pack them both up in my truck and take them to the DMV. Me and my father happily assuming there is no fucking way in hell she will pass. 

Aside from her vision issues, the amazingly quick witted and swift woman I grew up with was VERY unsure of her self at all times and took forever to make the smallest decisions. It broke my heart and it didn't even occur to me to be scared that she would get her license back.

Well she did, passed with ""Flying colors"" the DMV guy said. As a SAR (Search and Rescue) tech, the idea of taking him up in the helicopter and throwing him out without a rope occurred to me.

1 week later, accident number one. T-boned a poor lady as she was coming out of the grocery store. Not much damage and no injuries thankfully. Mother still refused to admit she wasn't fit to drive.

Month later, accident 2. She panics on a multi-lane cross city road and ends up on the raised median and rips the entire exhaust system off her car. Still won't admit any issues.

At this point I'm amazed I didn't have ulcers. Shortly after accident 2 my father passed away. I did everything up to and including begging to get her to give up the license. She wouldn't do it and for the next few months I spent every day with a knot in my stomach until I spoke to her around 6pm every night once she was ""home from running around"" 

Then around 1pm I get a call from her cell phone, this phone I bought her that she mostly ignored except to charge it. I couldn't understand a word she said she was so upset on the phone. I managed to get her general location out of her and hopped in a car and more then exceeded the speed limit getting down there.

Upon arriving there are two ambulances, shoes in front of her car and its up on the curb.

She's sitting on the curb next to it bawling her eyes out and I'm terrified she's killed someone.

Turns out a man and his son were walking out of the soccer pitch next to the road, began to cross on the cross walk and she didn't see them.

She thankfully only struck the father and aside from being banged up he wasn't super seriously injured.

Because of my job I knew most of the police officers in the city so one of them offered to follow me back to her house so she could take me back down to get her car.

By the time I had done so and got back to her condo she had stopped crying. Threw me the extra set of keys to the car she had and told me to get rid of the car.

She even tried to get the DMV worker that passed her fired after that. She immediately realized she shouldn't of ever gotten it back. She was actually terrified that she had been driving like that.

Years later she still comments about how she never even saw the man and his son and how she could of killed one or both of them.

I have all the respect in the world for seniors. My mother was one of the first women CEO's in this province and was a hellcat in her day. I learned a lot from her. But I also learned to accept limitations.

If you are older reading this post. If you think for even a second that you could maybe not be the safest person to be on the road, talk to and listen to your loved ones.

Its horrible to give up that freedom, it would be more horrible for you to kill some innocent person because you are too proud to give it up.

* Minimalism/Flat design, mostly due to the rise of tablets and browsing the internet on mobile devices. Clean lines, simple colors like black, white and grey.

* TV commercials: Early 2010s ads are backed by upbeat xylophone/triangle/whistling/hand clapping music, or people breakdancing or doing “the worm” to obnoxious dubstep music. The late 2010s have vivid colors and imagery, vaporwave-style aesthetics, and loud over-the-top spokespeople talking fast in the middle of the screen (think “Captain Obvious” from the Hotels.com commercials or Terry Crews from the Old Spice commercials)

* Entering a new golden age of automotive design. Almost every new car from the decade is elaborately styled. Car interiors with angular, intricate dashboards (like the Ford Escape, Chevy Equinox or Hyundai Santa Fe). This might end in the 2020s as crash safety technology requires more new cars to look the same, and car interiors will replace dashboards and gauges with touch screens (Thanks, Tesla).

* A move away from chain restaurants and the rise of food trucks and locally-owned restaurants that all feature string lighting, outdoor tables with giant Jenga blocks, Edison bulbs, and a craft beer selection written on a chalkboard.

* All houses are painted in that “griege” color and have all-white kitchens with that same white subway tile backsplash.

However, the (r)evolution was somewhat organic, and even though we experienced an economic downturn, the future looked bright.

The 10s were plastic. We let a reality TV show host become president. We realized the dystopian future that we read about in books and saw in movies. The boundaries of what is real have been stretched and shattered. The rich are living in a separate reality in their high rises and the poor are killing each other in the streets.

* An increase in small-dollar donations for political candidates, especially on the left.
* Increasing partisanship between the left and the right.
* A swing towards progressivism on the left (as seen by the rise of Sanders, Warren and AOC).
* The (slow) weakening of the Religious Right, as evidenced by the willingness of evangelicals to look the other way on their 'moral purity' tests, and the (depressingly speedy) rise of the Nationalist Right.

I bought a laptop from Dell, and from day 1 it was so riddled with problems, it was unusable. The simplest tasks took forever. Wifi, Ethernet and more crashed continuously, requiring a full power cycle to work again. Formatting & reinstalling Windows did nothing. Worst of all, Dell support did nothing but delay and delay.

One day I finally managed to have a Dell tech over to check it out. He confirmed the countless issues and called up Dell to say I require a replacement. I wait. He hangs up, and looks at me. ""Sorry... Red light"" (= no-go). And he had to leave me with this quite literal brick.

Late last year I found out that as consumer in the EU (The Netherlands specifically) I am well protected against this. I consulted with a bureau, and they believe that even though so much time has now passed, with such an extreme case, I am still able to get my $1000 back if I pursue it.

So that's exactly what I'm doing. I'm getting my money back from them, one way or another. Dell can go fuck themselves.

Edit: definition of ""red light"" added

Edit 2: Gold?! Thank you! Honestly, I thought this would get burried, but as a returning Dell customer that they royally screwed over, I'm happy this is getting the attention it is.

I consider it for a moment, inspecting each of the bills before nodding once and tucking it neatly into my coat. I turn around, inputting 6 digits into a wall-mounted safe. Inside is a brick and a remote. I turn around to him, offering the brick as I slip the remote into my pocket alongside the cash.

""Wait a minute..."" Realization begins to dawn on his face. ""You're... you're that guy from before.""

""I am.""

""Look, I'm sorry, man, but reddit made me do it. I'm sorry, but I'm not buying a thousand-dollar brick from you.""

""That's ok."" I turn around, tossing the brick back into the safe, where it lands with a *thunk* against the metal.

""Could I at least get my money back?""

""Sure. Have it back."" Reaching into my jacket pocket, my hand instead comes out with the remote. He begins to realize that something is wrong, but before he can do anything, I press the button and a hidden hatch in the ceiling above him slams open.

A rash reaction will only inflame things further. I would memorise the scammers facial features and bide my time stewing. 

Once I’d made the stew, I would begin to plot my revenge. Whilst eating the stew I imagine the answer would come to me. And as I’m sure you know, the answer involves constructing a multi-million dollar gravy and soup based corporation.

To begin, I need to recoup my losses. This will involve buying an ox and creating a mill and also heading into town to your local stationary supplier and picking up several small zip lock bags. I would first break up the brick into smaller pieces before placing them in the mill. Then I would use the ox to power the machine and keep going until the brick is ground down to a fine powder. Having achieved a good consistency, I would then seperate the ground up brick into very small amounts and put them in the zip lock bags.

Now wait for a Saturday night and head into town. Go to an establishment selling alcohol and playing popular music (or “pop” music as I believe it’s known) and look around. You’re looking for a particular type of person. He will be young, male, socially awkward; and trying desperately hard to impress every single female in the building but having no luck. Go and speak to him. Empathise with his struggles. Tell him that you might know a way that is guaranteed to improve his success with women. Tell him he needs to know about BRIX; the latest hallucinogenic substance from south of the border. BRIX is the drug of choice of the elite, the influencers, the popular. It’s a fine, red powder that comes in small zip lock bags. It doesn’t leave you half baked, it leaves you kiln baked. Tell him that you know an “importer of exotic substances” and that in 6 weeks time there will be a supply of BRIX in this very city; and that he (YES HE!) could be the only supplier. Imagine how popular he would be, especially with all those attractive women. Now take his number, tell him that you’ll be in touch; and let the hype grow.

After 6 weeks or so meet your contact and supply him with BRIX. Tell him to distribute the goods quickly and that you expect payment within 2 days. If I’ve learnt anything about drug dealing from watching movies (and I haven’t), it’s that this should net you about 2 million dollars (after tax of course). You may want to leave town for a while as inhaling brick dust can cause an incurable lung disease.

Whilst holidaying in Tahiti, instruct a legal professional to set up a company based in Kentucky. Call this company “Condiments Of Choice (Kentucky)”. With the company established, it’s time to get a marketable product. That means it’s time for a heist. Head to your local ski shop and purchase two sets of balaclavas or preferably bandanas. Then buy two horses. You probably won’t find them at the ski shop. Finally you’ll need 4 Colt 1851 Navy revolvers. The “Navy” is part of the name, not the colour of the gun. Contact your BRIX dealer again. At this point he will be desperate to escape the clutches of the law and will gladly follow you into criminal activity if it means you will get him across the border to Mexico. Head down to San Bernardino, California. Here you will find the Cajon rail pass, just 65 miles from downtown LA. Set yourself up by the tracks and wait. 

That’s right, it’s time to hijack the gravy train! You see, everyone talks about gravy boats; but that’s just a myth spread by “BIG GRAVY”. The real money is on the gravy train. It’s easily identifiable by the large gravy tankers it pulls, along with two very secure cargo cars. Inside these cars you’ll find all of the big gravy companies secret formulas. Ride your horse up alongside the train and climb aboard. Expect heavy resistance and shoot to kill. The hienz henchmen won’t hesitate to drown you in a vat of perfectly heated gravy if given the chance. Get to the safe and get the hell out of there and back to the Condiments Of Choice (Kentucky) head office. Once back at COC(K), use the secret formula to both blackmail rival companies and to improve on it to create your own condiment empire.

After several years of successful condiment creation, you may remember the reason you started on this journey; revenge. Cook yourself a stew, and let’s get to work. As your COC(K) is now the largest distributer of sauces in the world, you have developed a great deal of knowledge about your consumers; including one who appears to make absurd amounts of money selling bricks. Armed with his address you need to create a special gravy granule canister. It needs to have a plastic insert and a release mechanism built in so that when he removes the insert, the bag splits open and gravy granules pour out everywhere. That will show him. Now get in touch with your partner in crime from the gravy train heist. This is it buddy, one last job and then it’s margarita’s on a Mexican beach for you my friend.

Contact the scammer. Tell him that he (YES HE!) is the lucky winner of a years supply of COC(K) gravy and that someone will be visiting him in the next few days with the symbolic first canister. Pass the canister of gravy granules to your associate. When he arrives at the scammers location get him to hand over the tin and then take a photo with the scammer holding both the gravy, and a banner saying “I LOVE COC(K)!”. You can frame this later. Then at dinner, when he goes to make his gravy; BAAM! Gravy granules everywhere!

Of course if he paid any attention as he is cleaning up the mess, he would notice that the granules weren’t brown but more of a reddish colour; and if he continued to clean the rest of the house, he might find the small zip lock bags of BRIX that your associate hid before he left. The police certainly will after the anonymous tip off. And so the scammer rots in jail for possession of an illegal substance, whilst suffering from an incurable lung disease caused by the inhalation of brick dust; whilst share prices for the Condiments Of Choice (Kentucky) continue to rise. Could revenge be any sweeter?",You have just been cheated out of $1000 for a stupid brick. How do you take revenge?,0

I personally understand that it's ment with good intent, but on someone who is suicidal and not quite in their right mind it often has the opposite effect of where it feels like you're being shoved into a corner or dumped as someone elses problem. More often than not someone suicidal wants to talk to a normal person, someone who will care or listen to them, of course I am not telling strangers that you have to be that person - I know it shouldn't be anyone elses responsibility, all I am trying to say is that if you really want to help someone or make them feel better, linking them to something else is not a great way to go about it, it's much better worked into a conversation as a suggestion on the side.

Again, I don't want to come off as a dick here - I think it's great that so many people care enough to want to encourage others to seek help, but try to keep this in mind.

When you have depression it’s like it snows every day.

Some days it’s only a couple of inches. It’s a pain in the ass, but you still make it to work, the grocery store. Sure, maybe you skip the gym or your friend’s birthday party, but it IS still snowing and who knows how bad it might get tonight. Probably better to just head home.  Your friend notices, but probably just thinks you are flaky now, or kind of an asshole.

Some days it snows a foot. You spend an hour shoveling out your driveway and are late to work. Your back and hands hurt from shoveling. You leave early because it’s really coming down out there. Your boss notices.

Some days it snows four feet. You shovel all morning but your street never gets plowed. You are not making it to work, or anywhere else for that matter. You are so sore and tired you just get back in bed. By the time you wake up, all your shoveling has filled back in with snow. Looks like your phone rang; people are wondering where you are. You don’t feel like calling them back, too tired from all the shoveling. Plus they don’t get this much snow at their house so they don’t understand why you’re still stuck at home. They just think you’re lazy or weak, although they rarely come out and say it.

Some weeks it’s a full-blown blizzard. When you open your door, it’s to a wall of snow. The power flickers, then goes out. It’s too cold to sit in the living room anymore, so you get back into bed with all your clothes on. The stove and microwave won’t work so you eat a cold Pop Tart and call that dinner. You haven’t taken a shower in three days, but how could you at this point? You’re too cold to do anything except sleep.

Sometimes people get snowed in for the winter. The cold seeps in. No communication in or out. The food runs out. What can you even do, tunnel out of a forty foot snow bank with your hands? How far away is help? Can you even get there in a blizzard? If you do, can they even help you at this point? Maybe it’s death to stay here, but it’s death to go out there too.

The thing is, when it snows all the time, you get worn all the way down. You get tired of being cold. You get tired of hurting all the time from shoveling, but if you don’t shovel on the light days, it builds up to something unmanageable on the heavy days. You resent the hell out of the snow, but it doesn’t care, it’s just a blind chemistry, an act of nature. It carries on regardless, unconcerned and unaware if it buries you or the whole world.

Also, the snow builds up in other areas, places you can’t shovel, sometimes places you can’t even see. Maybe it’s on the roof. Maybe it’s on the mountain behind the house. Sometimes, there’s an avalanche that blows the house right off its foundation and takes you with it. A veritable Act of God, nothing can be done. The neighbors say it’s a shame and they can’t understand it; he was doing so well with his shoveling.

-

I don’t know how it went down for Anthony Bourdain or Kate Spade. It seems like they got hit by the avalanche, but it could’ve been the long, slow winter. Maybe they were keeping up with their shoveling. Maybe they weren’t. Sometimes, shoveling isn’t enough anyway. It’s hard to tell from the outside, but it’s important to understand what it’s like from the inside.

I firmly believe that understanding and compassion have to be the base of effective action. It’s important to understand what depression is, how it feels, what it’s like to live with it, so you can help people both on an individual basis and a policy basis. I’m not putting heavy shit out here to make your Friday morning suck. I know it feels gross to read it, and realistically it can be unpleasant to be around it, that’s why people pull away.

I don’t have a message for people with depression like “keep shoveling."" It’s asinine.  Of course you’re going to keep shoveling the best you can, until you physically can’t, because who wants to freeze to death inside their own house? We know what the stakes are. My message is to everyone else. Grab a fucking shovel and help your neighbor. Slap a mini snow plow on the front of your truck and plow your neighborhood. Petition the city council to buy more salt trucks, so to speak.  

Depression is blind chemistry and physics, like snow. And like the weather, it is a mindless process, powerful and unpredictable with great potential for harm. But like climate change, that doesn’t mean we are helpless. If we want to stop losing so many people to this disease, it will require action at every level.

I have a very busy life, so people ask me if I regret having her, since dogs are all high maintenance. I need to walk her a few times a day, feed her, keep her entertained, clean up after her, remove dog hair from everything including myself with an unending supply of lint rollers. 

I don't regret it. I got her for one purpose that I won't tell them. Because I'm lonely. Because when I'm at my loneliest, I don't have anyone to turn to, no-one to go see, to talk to, despite my best efforts. I have her because I know if I died, something would miss me, so I can't leave her. 

I left her at the dog boarding for an extra day after getting back from a work trip, earlier this week. I found myself calling for her, and she wouldn't come. For the first time in years, I just cried. I missed her. I wanted to sit on the couch and just pet her like she always loves. Fortunately, I could just grab her the next day. But it reminded me how important she is to my mental health. 

I recently turned down a job that would have required me to move to a place where I would have even less familial and friend support. I would have been traveling most of the year, so I would have to give up my dog. I'm glad I did. I had one friend tell me to ""absolutely not take the job""; he said if I took it, he gave me 6 months before I jumped off a bridge. I can't say he would be wrong. 

I used work to redirect my loneliness over the past several years, which ended up making it worse as it alienated me from those that I was close to. And then the company abandoned me; hired someone above me that openly tells people inside and outside of the company that he's trying to fire me. I have the CEO and President behind me, so he can't touch me; they know what I did for the company, my sacrifice, my skill, my dedication and loyalty. I now have much less responsibilities, so I can relax. 

Now, I'm here, with my dog, trying to decompress from my job, make more friends, actually date girls for the first time in many years of unsuccessfully trying. Things are starting to look better.

He was 15. My dad has been abusive but my brother suffered the most from him. He was my hero. I looked up to him and wanted to be like him. He’d take the fall for me when I did something that would cause my dad to punish me. I remember that morning vividly. I got back from school the previous day and went to go hang out with him in his room but his door was locked. I kept coming back but he wouldn’t answer the door. My parents weren’t worried because my brother usually kept to himself like that. When it was time for bed I told my dad to see if he could get the door open and he told me not to bother my brother again. After my brother didn’t come down for breakfast my father broke his door and we found him hanging from the ceiling. I wish I didn’t see that. I screamed the entire time and wouldn’t left go of his hand. It felt cold and my mother had to peel me away. He left a suicide note and a hand written will. He left me his favourite book. I miss you Jeff. 

Edit: Thank you so much everyone for the love. 

Edit 2: My dad kept repeating “why Jeffery? Why? and tried to get him down from the fan. I was screaming PLEASE JEFF! and pulling his hand and when my mom couldn’t separate our hands she pulled me away. She was crying so hard. I remember kicking my legs in the air and screaming “you should have opened his door for me”

Edit 3: The book is Animal farm by George Orwell. I always carry it with me now. Whenever he’d read it to me I’d make fun of how the big words sounded funny and we’d laugh. 

There wasn’t much in his will. He left me the book and his game boy. He left my mom his wrist watch. My dad didn’t get anything in the will. 

Edit 4: Wow I woke up to a ton of supportive messages and so much love. Thank you for all your kind words. I’ve never spoken about the details before and I pray this helps someone who is struggling. To all the Jeff’s, I know it’s hard but please be strong. You don’t want to have your family calling your name and you not answering. It’s the most painful thing ever. For years I had nightmares of trying to save him but each time I’d get there too late. 

In his note he said he was really sorry and didn’t mean to hurt any of us but he just couldn’t bear the pain anymore. He said he hoped it would make my dad stop being disappointed in him and called me his best bud in the world. He told my mom he loved her and hoped she’d find the courage he didn’t have.

But 11 years ago, I was desperate enough to believe that everyone who knew me would be better off without me. I believed that the scales weighed heavily against me - that I caused more harm than good - and that if I simply didn't exist, it would make things better for everyone.

So I started counting my pills. I'd been seeking treatment for depression for five months, but nothing was working. The meds made me worse, or they made me so apathetic that I found no joy in life, or they gave me such bad side effects that I could barely stay lucid. I thought there was no way out. So I was counting my pills, trying to figure out how many would cause an overdose so I could take them, lie down in bed, and die.

I'd arranged them all nicely, counted out every single one. I'd positioned my glass of water next to them all, and I stood staring at the scene, feeling *so* overwhelmed because the intensity and duration of my suffering had been so drawn out, and it just wasn't getting better. It had been years. *Years*. A slow decline until a breakdown, and then I was in so deep I couldn't see a way out.

Then the phone rang. It was a friend of mine, a Catholic priest, who said he felt moved to call me and see how I was doing in case things were bad. I lied to him; I told him that I was fine, that I was receiving treatment and that I was hopeful that things would start looking up. But I didn't think I had any fight left in me. He told me that he believed I did, and that he hoped I could hang on awhile longer.

I hung up the phone and burst into tears - ugly, inconsolable crying, snot dripping out my nose, curled up in a ball. But my friend had planted a seed of hope. *Someone* believed in me, even if I couldn't. And I guess I felt that I owed it to him - and to my family - to try.

I managed to get an appointment at the emergency psychiatry clinic awhile later, and there I met the psychiatrist who prescribed the drug that saved my life. I got into a daily outpatient program at the hospital. I met other people who were like me, and I found myself believing in them - believing that they could fight, that they could get better, even though I didn't believe I could. Somehow, they said they believed in me, too. And so for a second time, I saw that other people believed in me, even if I didn't. And I felt again that I should try.

So I tried. I got into weekly therapy with a psychiatrist, and I was in her care for seven years. She adjusted my meds as needed and we began the long, arduous process of untangling the mess that was my mind. She never gave up on me. (I'm in a country where she doesn't make money off me. She gets a flat salary.) 

Now, it's 11 years later, and things *have* gotten better. I am better now than I ever have been. It took awhile after my rock bottom moment to find that spark of hope within myself, but I did find it, and that is what kept me going. It made me look for anything I could to keep me hanging on, and even now, it's the small things in life that keep me here. When the moon shines through my window at night and pools on my pillow. When the white blossoms on that weird bush in the backyard finally bloom for one week every year, and I can smell them on the wind. When my dog wakes up in the morning and comes to get me because he is happy I am awake. When the sun shines just right, or the wind sends petals filtering down through the trees, or the world is silent and glittery after a fresh snowfall.

I find those moments, and I ""keep"" them. I commit them to memory so that when things get bad again, I can remember what I love about this life, and remind myself to keep hanging on. 

I still get low.Two years ago, I had been fired from my job and was certain I would never become a fully functional adult and I would always have to fight tooth and nail just to exist in society. I stood on a subway platform and listened to the rattle of the trains and tried to convince myself not to jump. The tracks were hypnotising, almost. I looked up and found myself staring at a poster for suicide prevention, and the irony was not lost on me. It broke the trance. I stepped back from the yellow line and went home. I stayed.

Last month, I got slapped in the face with a bout of severe depression out of nowhere, and then my dog passed away, which made it worse. (Dogs immensely improve my mental health.) But I stayed.

You can stay, too. 

Take it day by day. For those of us with severe mental health issues, that's all we can do - take it day by day, see how we feel, see if there are any little joys we can find and savour them. You have to cultivate the ability to find them, and it might not be easy at first. (I'm a stubborn ass and was originally so intent on believing that there was nothing good in the world that it took me a couple years to learn how to look closer.) But eventually, you'll have a breakthrough. Maybe you'll see a toddler get pegged by a ball and you'll fall over laughing. Maybe you'll hear the cicadas buzz in the heat of August and remember how awesome summers felt as a kid. Maybe you'll find an indie game on Steam that has a really compelling story and you'll find that you can't WAIT to get back to it and find out what happens next. You never know.

But you can stay. Just take it day by day. And you can see what happens.

My kidneys shut down, dialysis was required. I sustained nerve damage due to cut off blood circulation and I had to learn to walk again. Couldn’t pee normally. Multiple operations were required to fix the pressure ulcer mess. I hated that I was found before I died.

Time passed by and things gradually became better. Aside from nerve pains and a partially paralysed foot I fully recovered. I found a good job, people that supported me and an environment in which I could recover. 

Bit by bit I crawled out of the dark hole. I came across someone who loved me, she became my wife and we have been happily married for 3 years. I became a dad and there are times when I’m the happiest guy in the world. I’m so extremely grateful that I made it out of the darkness alive.

My best friend, who I met in a psychiatric hospital, didn’t find his way to the light. He sunk deeper, couldn’t take it anymore and committed suicide. Unfortunately he succeeded. The world turns on but he will be 26 forever. 

It’s extremely confronting to feel how much it hurts when someone you love, sinks too deep and leaves this world. For friends and family it’s a scar that never heals. If only he had found his place in the world, it would have been different.

Whoever you are that reads this, and is sinking so deep that death seems inevitable: try to fight like you never fought before, and don’t give up. Do it for the people that love you, but more important, try to do it for your future self. 

Somewhere there is a place for you to heal, I wholeheartedly hope you will find it. Stay strong and keep going for the light.",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

They just do not know what else to do. 

Some are truly devastatingly depressed or mentally ill. But this is not uniformly true. Many many people who are suicidal are genuinely not ""mentally ill."" 

Speaking of myself a long time ago now and others I have known - there are people out there whose suicidal ideation is a ""logical"" analytic response to essentially impossible life pressures and situations and - right or wrong - it can feel very hurtful, even offensive, and unhelpful to tell them their thinking is clouded. 

I and others I have known used the same basically functional working (but very very stressed) analytic mind to **choose* not to commit suicide.  

As I moved through that place and eventually out of it, I had to hold onto the ""option"" in my mind and make the choice -- albeit increasingly more easily -- many times before it was gone. 

All that and this too - please don't turn people into messages or PSAs. Suicide is absolutely horrible - I have been affected by its aftermath more times than I care to share, very directly and less intimately as well. It is probably almost never the right thing to do (save terminal illness, etc) but its important to honor lives as more than their ending. ",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

It gets better. It genuinely does. Even when you’re in the deepest hole. But you can’t do it alone. You can’t just cover over your issues. You need to destroy them.

In Canada, you can get referred to therapists for free by your family doctor. It takes a long time, but the wait is worth it. In the meantime, tell your friends. If they’re your true friends, they’ll understand. And, if you’re like me, you’ll find out that they’re going through the same thing.

We'll call him Harry. He was a very close friend of my boyfriend's and they had big dreams about their future together as best friends. However, myself and Harry would always end up clashing (we were younger then, a lot of thinking things were more important than they were - he was also seeing a very close friend of mine and that relationship was turbulent as well, battle lines were drawn and then they weren't and then they were. We were young. I can't tell you how important it all felt at the time and now it feels so insignificant). 

Harry and I were civil a lot of the time, occasionally we weren't. We both tried hard for the sake of my boyfriend and his girlfriend/my friend to get along, and I'm happy in retrospect that we were. 

There were times when he and I would meet to ""start again"" and try and become friends, have a coffee, chat, but it didn't ever last.

Before he died I invited him to come round and play board games in a few weekends with my boyfriend and I. He replied a few days later saying he wasn't feeling well but that he would come. I talked to him about coldsores (we both got them), and then that was it. 

The following Saturday they found him. My boyfriend was inconsolable and it was so sunny outside and I couldn't understand. He phoned his friends and he said it's not good news and from his end of the phone call he kept saying through tears ""I'm not joking"", because that's all the receiver could believe. It had to be a sick joke. 

I felt incredibly uncomfortable around Harry's family. I felt an imposter for grieving when our grievances were well known. I was livid that he did this, and I felt desolate that this happened, and I felt responsible that I didn't pick up on his message. I later learned I was the only person he messaged that week. Closer friends would interrogate me and ask did I suspect anything, what did the message say, what did I say back? I felt ashamed that it never occurred to me, and I was desperately apologetic to people who asked for comfort that I couldn't give.

Friends drove from all over to go see his family, people we'd not seen since college but still had incredibly strong friendships with, and we all sat against the wall of Harry's mom's garden and smoked. We laughed a lot too. In the sunshine. Funny stories and then someone would sob and my heart would break. I was so sorry.

The nights were worse. My boyfriend was spiralling. He couldn't sleep and when he did he would jolt awake and remember and be miserable. He would cry and look at photos of the two of them and nobody went to counselling. I should have insisted. Everyone should have gone. He went eventually. As far as I know all the men went eventually. The people who went earlier fared better than the ones who waited.

Harry's brothers told them if anyone felt that way they should say something, speak to someone. They all nodded. 

I started having dreams of Harry in awful situations. The nature in which he died bled in to my nights and I would see him in all these different ways and I would be tortured. The hardest was when I dreamt he had to go and see his family, but he stopped by me first. I knew that I had to tell him to talk to someone, but as is the nature of dreams, I knew if I told him he would go and he wouldn't get to see his family again. I woke up sorry and responsible again.

I thought about Harry every day for the first two years. Every single day. It scared me that life moved on. But it didn't really because we still spoke about it in coffee shops and at the beach, we were just older.

 I thought of my own mortality a lot. I was terrified that my boyfriend would do the same thing. Every time my boyfriend went to the store I would count minutes until I was in a panic, terrified he wasn't coming back, but too afraid to tell him, in case I would plant a seed in his head. Irrational, but everything that had happened was not how it should have been.

When he would get drunk my boyfriend would become very meloncholy. There was a time by a harbour when i was out of the country and I phoned his mom. It took a long time for him to get help, and that happened when I said, after years, that i didn't know if I could do this - the fear was suffocating and his sadness was hurting me. I sound selfish, but it hurt. I would dread opening the door after work in case inside was something I didn't want to see. 

I started to think of Harry less in a sad way as the years went on. But not completely happy either. I can't tell you how much he used to aggravate me, I still feel the red hot anger of delayed adolescence when he would deliberately provoke me. I still feel the anchor sit in the sandy pit of my stomach when I remember the day he died, my world spinning in a wild orbit, and how it was so sunny and we saw a friend and drank coffee in his garden and sobbed.

I still remember how I choked at the funeral. It was the blackest sadness I've ever felt.

And I didn't even like him.

If I could see him I would beg him to get help, I'd refuse to let him out of my sight until he was safe, I would tell him that things would be ok even though he really didn't feel like it, and more than anything I would ask him how he was doing. I would listen to him and I would do anything, anything I could to prevent it.

I didn't like him and I am still so desperately sorry about his death.

I didn't even like him and I absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt would prefer him here to annoy the shit out of me. Every day, relentlessly. 

I didn't even like him and my life has felt it's been in vignette since he died. A little out of focus at the periphery, a little black around the edges.

Please seek help. It will affect so many more people than you know.

I'm manic depressive and am used to the ups and downs, but this low didn't go away. I thought I was stronger than my depression but it just kept going. After about 6 months my spouse was just barely able to hang in there and was spending a lot of time at her mother's in another town because I was just such a fucking asshole and was losing myself. Christmas night that year, wife was at her family's celebration, I sat in our guest bedroom alone and had my 9mm in my hand. I struggled and was crying and angry and a fucking nightmare was unfolding in my head. I couldn't do it though. I let my dog in and be jumped on me and was licking me and wagging his tail, so I hung out with him for a while and put the gun away. I promised my wife I would try to make the changes necessary to recover and fast forward to today, we're halfway through her pregnancy with our first! It's a boy! I'm very physically active and I have things to work towards, and now a son coming that deserves a great set of parents. My wife is incredible and she stuck with me through times where I would have left myself... She did what she could when she could, considering how much I was pushing everyone away during that time. I can never repay her for being loyal to me when I don't think I deserved loyalty, I just hope I can give her and my son the best husband and dad possible for the rest of our lives. 

Edit: at the time, I was planning to make everyone hate me so no one would miss me when I finally killed myself. It was a dark pattern that made me lose who I was. I am a different person today and I have learned to recognize the signs and not ignore my ""small lows"". I never miss a chance to tell my wife how wonderful she is.

wednesday last week was supposed to be my last day. i started taking hella pills in the morning, but i still went to school. i distanced myself from my group of friends, saying that i had a migraine. i had already said my goodbyes to them in my mind. 

i went to see my mom in the hospital afterwards. i was mentally apologizing to her about what i was about to do. 

then she sat me down and talked to me about how she was feeling. she told me that she was thankful that i was always there for her; small things like how i stayed with her the whole day during mother’s day, even though she knew that i was bored out of my mind. she told me that she was so thankful that i was around to help take care of my siblings. she told me that i was one of the pillars of her strength, and that she would always love me, no matter what. she told me that she didn’t know what she would do without me, and that my faith in her is what gives her strength everyday.

If I didn't come home one day, he'd never stop sitting by the door waiting for me. He'd never stop missing my smell and my voice. He'd never stop wishing for one more walk, one more game of chasing the laser with me, one more high-five for a treat. He'd never stop jumping to peek out the window when he heard somebody coming up the sidewalk, and letting his heart be filled with a moment's joyful hope. No matter how many times that hope was dashed, he'd never let go of it. He's kind of a doofus that way.

Anybody else in my life might eventually get over it. You can explain to them what happened and they'd at least be able to understand if not accept it. But my little brown dog would sit forever wondering why I didn't come home. And he's had a hard enough life so far. I was his only friend when he had nobody, and he was mine.

No matter what I'm going through in life, putting him through that sort of suffering is not something my soul would ever let me do. Otherwise, I probably would have done it already. 

Life is random. There's no fate. There's no karma. ""The Secret"" doesn't actually work, except for making the people who wrote those books rich. There's no magic Santa Claus in the sky making sure all the good people are blessed and the bad people are punished. Maybe God exists, but he sure doesn't interfere. I've been praying for decades for some sort of help, or at least guidance so I can help myself. No response. No answers either. For example, why did a loving God let such an abusive monster come into my mom's life when I was a kid, turning me into an emotional cripple who can't deal with any sort of stress without crumbling? Why does child abuse happen every single day in this world? No response.

So a sane person can only conclude that it's all just random. 

That can be scary. But it can also be liberating. It means that the sheer law of averages will save your ass at some point. It can't all be bad forever. That breaks the laws of the universe. At some point something randomly good will happen. The scales will eventually balance. There's no intelligence behind it. It's just chaos that's part good and part bad. Accept it. Fighting it won't change anything.

One thing's for sure, though. Those who are prepared for the random things that come their way will have a better time dealing with them. Sit exactly on the middle line between optimism and pessimism. Prepare for emergencies so that they don't destroy you, and enjoy the good things to the fullest when they do come. But overall, just wait and watch, knowing and accepting that nothing can be good forever, but neither can anything be bad forever. ",Suicide Prevention Megathread,1

Or even when you do tell them you are having issues, and they shrug it off because they aren't in your place and they can't understand. What do you do? Nothing, you're alone.

I was depressed for a little over a year, and that year felt like an eternity. I felt like a prisoner in my own mind. Depression feels like.. being stuck in a dark, cramped, windowless room. You can't see anything, you can't move, you're suffocating. You're panicking. There are people on the outside telling you that they will figure out a way to get you out. That they are with you. But in truth they have no idea what to do and you're not even sure if they are trying, or if they even care.  

People who care will actually do something about it. They will drag you out of bed, kicking and screaming to get you to a hospital, or a mental institute, or a appointment with a therapist, or psychologist. And the only reason I ever got better was because someone physically forced me to leave my house and see a doctor. And even after being denied and confused about where to find help, he spent the entire day with me, driving around town to different hospital locations to find me a psychologist. Because that's what good friends fucking do. So stop telling people that you are there just to talk, and instead actually take action to help them. People who have depression are so enclosed within their room that they can't reach out to people, and that is why people are dying from suicide.

One of my earliest memories was finding my mum crying in her bedroom holding a noose that she had found in the loft. (I didn't understand at the time). It took me a long time to realise that - actually, its not normal for a parent to drink themselves into oblivion and take a handful of drugs or slit their wrists! He was later diagnosed with bipolar. 

Fast forward when I was a teenager my parents had split up, dad was steeply declining in his mental health, still drinking heavily. Still attempting/threatening suicide almost weekly.
He would attempt to run into walls with knives against his stomach until I'd grab him, constantly overdose. Cut himself.

My mum then remarried. I always felt a responsibility to keep my dad happy and safe so left my mums wedding early to meet my dad to make sure he was holding up OK. Of course we met in the pub, still in my bridesmaid dress, my dad walked over to me very wobbly - I assumed he was drunk. He flopped his arm around me and told me he was going to get another drink as he walked away my dress was completely covered in blood  across my waist. He had slit his wrist in a zig zag from inner elbow to his hand.
I told the barman what had happened, walked out the door, burst into tears and ran 2 miles home.
At this stage I had completely had enough, I remember vividly thinking ""I just wish he would get it over and done with so I don't have to deal with it!""
 But still I went up every day to make sure he was eating, taking his meds and generally keeping him company. 
At 15 I hadn't been up in around a week, my best friend and I had planned a girls night around our mutual friends house and popped in to see my dad on the way over. 
As soon as I walked into the communal corridor I smelt it. I knew. 
Found him led on his living room floor, flat on his back with his eyes open. Flies crawling on his arms. 
Called for an ambulance (silly - I know, I was 15 and thought they could save him) 
I don't think anyone realises the physical pain of being told ""I'm sorry he's been gone for some time, there's nothing we can do) until they go through it, it feels like a knife to the chest. 
The aftermath of so many 'I didn't think he would ever actually do it's' was astounding. 

Please, if ever somebody tells you somebody self harms for attention, take them damn seriously. There are only so many cries of help people can give!

No one saw it coming. This is someone who had a very bright future ahead of him. He was all set to take over the family business. He was a quarter back in high school and also rode dirt bikes, and he was really good at both. He loved to fish and hunt, he was passionate about a lot of things in life, especially his 2 year old daughter. He had a beautiful and infectious smile. Anyway, he caught his girlfriend cheating on him one night, and apparently she was sending him pictures of her with the guy. He was heartbroken. They had a baby together, and lived together. I remember him telling me all he wanted was his family back. She moved out and shortly after he saw her at a bar with her new boyfriend, the bar where both my step sister and step brother worked and one that she knew my brother frequented. Why she chose to go to that bar with him is beyond me. My brother got shitfaced and showed up at her new apartment. He pointed the gun at her new boyfriend and when his ex got on the phone with the police, he turned it on himself. I remember vividly going over there two day after to pick up my niece, and the blood stain was still there in the breezeway. 

My dad got a knock on his door at 3am, it was two state troopers telling him his only son was gone. I remember the phone call, my sister telling me he shot himself, and it didn’t even fully register. All I could do was mutter “is he alive?”. I remember sitting around my kitchen table with my family, all of us just quietly crying. My dad almost sold his boat because they would fish together, and it was too painful to take it out anymore. I’m happy to say that 8 years later my dad just went to Lake Erie, by himself, and he said he felt like my brother was on the lake with him. It almost gets harder as time goes on because you start to remember less and less about them, and the memories are all you have. My niece is the spitting image of him, having her around is like having a piece of him with us, she’s very special to us! 

What his suicide did to me personally is a whole different story. He was my best friend, and after he died I went down a very dark path. I self medicated and became addicted. At one point the only thing that was keeping me from hanging myself from a pipe in my basement was that I couldn’t imagine putting my dad through the pain of losing another child. The following 5 years after his death I put my family through hell all over again, i was still alive but actively trying to kill myself with drugs. I have been sober for 4 years, have a beautiful son now, and I am set to graduate college this December. Life is pretty good! We miss him every day and the pain of losing him will never go away, but where there is life, there is hope. There is never someone who is too far gone or that can’t turn things around, I am proof. The only reason I’m still here is because I finally surrendered, and got the help I needed. I wish my brother had done the same. None of us had any idea what he was going through mentally.

This might be true for someone who suffers from situational depression. The depression that goes away.

For someone with chronic depression it never truly goes away. It is not a temporary problem. It can be managed. You can be better. You can learn to live almost normally. 

But when a person has been suffering for years, barely living, barely able to get out of bed most morning, it's not a temporary problem.

When I was in my worst depressed state and I heard that saying for the first time, what I heard was: ""It's a permanent solution to a permanent problem"" And you know what? That was comforting. It was encouraging in the wrong way. I wanted to just cease to exist. Not have to worry about waking up the next morning. 

What got me through was knowing that I would destroy my children's lives. I knew they would blame themselves. Even if I thought they were better off without me there and that I was damaging them. If I took my life it would be much worse for them.

I started therapy. And that was the hardest thing I have ever done. Just finding a therapist was way harder than it should have been. I decided to show my kids that even though I was damaged and broken I could be strong.

I started being selfish in a good way. I started taking care of myself. If I couldn't get out of bed one day I didn't. I only did the bare minimum of what needed to be done. I dropped the kids off at school and came home and slept or just watched tv. I picked up the kids from school and ordered pizza.

But I only gave myself one day. My therapist called it my isolation day. The next morning I got up. I set goals for my self. One a week. Something simple. When I accomplished that goal I celebrated. Then set a new one for the next week.

My first goal was just going to the hardware store and picking out the paint for a furniture refab I wanted to do. When I say my therapist next I showed her a picture of my finished project. She was so proud of me she hugged me.

It's been a long hard journey and it will never end but I have learned to find joy in my life. I will never be cured and I will always have bad episodes but that's ok. I know they will end and I can get back to living.

There's an organization called ""Always keep fighting"" I've chosen to live by those words. When things are bad I take a sharpie and under my watch band write the letters AKF. I can just look at it remember that I am strong and I can get through this.",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

The...temptation of suicide is ever present once it's blossomed, I think. The idea abates but lingers, biding its time. You can still have so many things to be happy for, so many things to be Pollyanna-GLAD about, and still, the sticky sweet singsong of, ""but you could be done. You could be over it and not struggling any more. You could REST."" chirps persistently in your ear. 

Many times friends say, ""come, talk to me when you feel this way."" Therapists ask you to be open with them - ""are you feeling suicidal right now?"" At first, you want to trust them. But - almost always - with friends, you end up having to reassure THEM that you aren't going to ACTUALLY go through with it. The emotional toll of reassuring someone else when you are already feeling drained and fragile is a lodestone around the neck, cement shoes on a river during the first freeze. And therapists, bless their hearts (and I do mean that in the very Southernist way I can manage), tend to react and report you rather than listening. 

Say you end up in the hospital because you chose to check yourself in instead of follow through with your plan. You may also - as low income - end up in a facility with heavy drug users and addicts and other lost little puppies such as yourself, and you'll get so heavily medicated you walk around in an apathetic fog, still struggling to breath in enough air to not die in a way that feels more like murder. Group therapy will become the bane of your existence. ""Here, rip open your wounds in the company of strangers. You're safe here!"" a perky fresh-out-of-college or drained dead-around-the-eyes doctor will say. Nurses chat cherrily with patients. ""Oh, you'll be back! They always are."" 

So you withdraw more. You tuck away the horror you feel at the prospect of trudging through more struggles, bill roulette and day after day, week after week, of trudging through the motions at work. You hide your loneliness,  which at times threatens to overwhelm you with a black tidal wave of nothingness, under a veneer of cheerfulness and compassion and empathy. You learn to make your smile reach your eyes and body language when you want to weep for how much you long to be able to hold out your arms to someone - anyone - and say, ""help me! I just want to belong, to fit in, to have a place that feels like the Home I've read of in the stories."" But you can't, and so you go about your days smiling but still hearing the quiet weeping of a small child tucked into a corner in the back room of your mind. 

And sometimes the weeping abates, and sometimes the beauty and joy around you slip in, like glorious little snapshots in a world full of dark gray. And you feel content. Warm, even. Happiness. And then, not right away, but eventually the crying of the small child is audible again. And you have to play the game of, ""reasons - what reasons do I have to stay. What reasons do I have that prevent me from leaving."" 

Yeah. Suicide can be seen as selfish. You like to think you own a piece of those who you love just as you give pieces of yourself to them to cherish as well. But sometimes - sometimes - on the days and nights when the weeping is the loudest, an inky black ocean of sorrow lapping at your feet as the tide threatens to come up and fully overwhelm you at last, as the storm clouds in your mind darken, and the apathy threatens to steal your very last sliver of breath from your very lips, then yes. I can understand - much better than I ever wished to - why the siren song of suicide could overcome a person, no matter how hard they tried to fight it. 

And hopefully, HOPEFULLY, if you didn't before, you can now too. ",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

I can’t imagine leaving my pets behind and when I get emotionally distressed I go over and pet them in silence and it helps me calm down a little more and straighten myself out.  It’s hard, but it’s something.      Therapy helped me and my family open up to each other about things that I kept in that caused me to go over the edge.

We were in a city in West India far away from our hometown in the south. My parents were having troubles in their marriage and my Dad would head over to the factory and work twelve hour shifts.

I remember her crying a lot and feeling alone. I remember her striking a matchstick and pouring kerosene over her body. I remember crying and asking her to stop and then trying to fill a bucket of water in vain hoping to douse the flames that would soon engulf the apartment. 

I managed to get out of the house and I took my little sister with me. The man living below our house came up to see what the commotion was all about and he made me promise to only tell the police that it was just an accident so that my Dad wouldn't be investigated or kept in jail for a long while.

My grandmother practically brought me up and I resented my Dad and my sister for a long time. Even as we moved countries and my life improved materially, I would frequently break into fights with my Dad and I barely interacted with my stepmom.

Yeah, we’re all in debt up to our eyeballs, we all work crazy work hours for well under what we’re worth, we’re constantly bombarded by 24/7 media stimuli, but at least people in the past had their community to rely on when life went to shit.

I know the intentions are the best, but posting numbers to a suicide hotline and saying “go find someone to talk to” are kind of the equivalent of “thoughts and prayers” after a tragedy. I think we really need to re-evaluate the direction our culture is moving.",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

I had a date planned, I had a method, I had things I wanted to do and I had done it all, I had even practiced what I wanted my note to be, I had a glorious vision of people coming back to the area for my funeral and getting together again to have a good time. 

That’s when I realized I was being delusional, no one coming to my funeral would be having a good time. They would all be miserable. The note wouldn’t explain it well enough, no matter how many times I rewrote it in my head I couldn’t get it so that people would understand. My mother, she would never understand, ever. 

So, I thought about it. Most of the shit I’m worried about, it’s just shit I’m worried about. If I just stopped caring about it, it would no longer be shit I’m worried about. I mean killing myself is the end, There is nothing worse that can happen to you at that point, the game is over. Maybe I just needed to start a new game, one where I was free from the shit holding me down in this one. 

I decided I would try one more time. I’ve already lost this life. I’m here, about to kill myself tomorrow, I’ve lost, but I can start a new game, one more fucking try. This way I can restart my life without ruining the lives of others. I mean me taking my life would ruin the lives of so many around me. I can’t do that, I just want to end mine. 

So I did, I ended it by deciding to try again cause fuck it, what worse thing could I do that I haven’t already done? The only thing is kill myself, so if I don’t do that, this new life will be better than the last one. I decided to play the game, one more time. 

Since then I still think about suicide, but not multiple times a day. I don’t harp on it and dream everyone would be better off without me, cause they wouldn’t. My parents would be crushed. My siblings would be crushed. I would have traded my broken ass self for breaking a piece in each of them. 

So anyway, one more time, can’t hurt any more than it did this time right? One more time, and if I fuck up this one, it will probably be one more time again. ",Suicide Prevention Megathread,1

So I bandaged up, cleaned up, and went to lay down to re-evaluate my life. Probably should have had stitches but I wasn't ready to admit I had ""problems"".

Saying he was my godfather just doesn't do it justice. He was more like an older brother to me while he was my parent age he watched me grow and acted like a kid, he loved to just come over to my house and sit down in my room for hours keeping me company and playing games with me. He marveled at the new technology that came out and how video games were evolving. And whenever he would come over when I was with friends we would all run I say hi to him and jump to give him hugs.

I have a very vivid memory of showing him super MARIO galaxy when it came out and playing on the world with the water bowl and swinging in circles on a vine. He thought it was the coolest thing in the world replying ""Wow. This is wild."" He seemed to be the only adult in my life that still wanted to keep up on what I was interested in.

Flash forward to 2013 where I'm a junior in high school. I'm having my issues with my mom and he's been around the house a lot as he's been feeling down. I enjoyed having him here. Made the house feel more alive and he was someone I could talk to when frustrated. I wish I had known how much pain he was in, I wish I asked him how he was doing. I was not ignorant to his depression but I did not know it's extent.

One day I am in my room on my bed and my mother walks to the door. I already knew what she was going to say. She was crying, I knew what had happened. My mother and he were very close and during this time I became a support for my mother as well as my other family members. I was so worried about them that I feel I barely processed his death even to this day.

At his funeral I knew that I had to speak, he was the closest thing to an older brother I had and I wanted to say that I loved him. When I spoke everyone knew who I was. I didn't know how, but I came to find out that he had told all of the people in his life who I was, how I was growing, and the person I was turning into. It was too much for me to handle and for the first time since finding out about his death I cried. I cried through the words I spoke about how I wish he knew how much I enjoyed hanging out with him, how much I loved spending my birthdays with him or walking through rivers together. I wish I had given him a call to tell him that I loved him.

I foresee that debt in the form of paying for a service to try and make me feel better or even the cost of depresssion medication. Then god only knows what side effects would come with that, etc.

I feel trapped most of the time. I owe more than my salary in student loans, which means I’ll likely never be able to marry or own a home or really make any decision at all that is bigger than buying a video game or two.

Video games for me are an escape, while playing I don't think about anything else and time just go by fast.

Adding to that tragedy, she was several months pregnant. An emergency c-section was done at the scene (she ran her car into a tree at ~90mph) and the baby ended up dying a few hours later. I didn't cope. Not as in I didn't cope well, I simply didn't. I drank a lot. I got into a lot of really unhealthy relationships. I took a lot of risks of all sorts. Finally around 27 I decided to talk to a professional to deal with the grief. The woulds still felt fresh after all that time.

I also have depression. Bipolar II and major depression that lasts for months, if not more than a year sometimes. In 2012 I was ready to take my own life. Meticulous planning was made to ensure success and I had all of my affairs in order (closing internet accounts, letters written, a sheet printed for my wife for my online financial and insurance accounts, etc). I sat in my car for a long time when I was going to do it. I thought about my wife and my father, the two people that it would effect the most. I know what living through losing a loved one to suicide is like.

I called the therapist that I was working with and he had me come in. I tend to avoid talking about some things, so I handed her one of the letters. She called in the supervising psychiatrist for that office and he pulled a lot of strings to get me a bed at McClean Hospital near Boston. I said that I'd go the next morning because I wanted to pack a few things before heading up there. He looked at me and said I can go voluntarily tonight, or involuntarily; either way, I was going that night.

My wife was called to take me to the hospital. I'll never forget the sheer look of pain and helplessness on her face. She's the strongest person I know and I've seen her hold her shit together if horrific situations, but she just broke down sobbing uncontrollably. She didn't know I was that bad off. Neither did anyone else. It's easier to put on the act, and I was good at acting happy. I feel tremendously guilty for causing her so much pain even to this day.

My plans were so detailed, so foolproof that it was just a matter of counting down the days, mainly because I wanted to get past my Kid's 5th birthday on 5/18 (for a final photo-op for her) and then make it out before the middle of June.  Starting from March '17, it was such a bleak time that I couldn't see past June. It was a wall that I was speeding towards and I didn't have any brakes and the fear and panic of living were consuming me so much that I just drowned in depression. 

I made my rounds, had my 'final' moments with friends (they didn't know) and then had a final talk with my therapist. All of this between May 28th and the first week of June. The closer it got to the end of the first week in June, the calmer I became, knowing it would be all over. I'd finally be at peace

Then in one unidentifiable moment, it all changed. Suddenly there was no impending doom. I made it into the second week, and then the third week of June and while I still was depressed, it wasn't this end-all-be-all ultimatum that my brain concocted. The days came and went one at a time and I was still around. 

Here I am, almost a year to the day of my scheduled demise, and I can't fathom how on earth I could have left my wife and daughter alone. I've had so many great moments and made so many memories that now I have a crippling fear of dying. 

The pendulum has swung. I called my brother from another mother and I mentioned this to my last visit with my therapist: Suicidal thoughts, when it's occurring, seems like the only possible way out - once you pass that threshold (if you can) you'll see that it was a terrible, horrible trick of the mind (sorry, it's the only way I can explain it.)

If you're suicidal, let someone know. If you're depressed, get into some CBT classes, or therapy groups, tell your story, listen to others and realize that you're not alone and that your problem isn't as bad as those other people's. Someone always has it worse than you and they're still around - fighting. 

Waking up out of that fog is such a ""lost in a forest' feeling that you spend some time feeling your way around living. Then you realize that after a fair amount of time passes by that suicide

I'm fortunate that my wife has a good health plan that affords me to go to a great therapist. I know others don't have that luxury. If you're one of the other, there are resources online, support chat room, even walk-in clinics. Just ask someone, go to the ER if you have to and just ASK. 

Fight to live. Battles are hard fought, but make sure you are armed to win the war on life.  Help is out there, you just have to realize you need it and accept it.

Be strong. Keep Living.

First of all id like to say im better now  ( ive been listening to Powerwold , Dethklok and metallica all day so that helps) so heres the basic jist of it I failed one of my finals , and even if I pass the other two I have to wait until August to retake it which probably means I wont get into the collage of my choice hooray, so id have to wait a year before  doing it , basically waste a year, I felt so shit about failing that I didnt eat or drink anything all day ( and considering it was 30+ degrees outside well says something) I felt so disappointed in myself that I failed just so shit , my dad was disappointed and was like "" wtf can I even tell you youre not your brother you understand what happened so see you can do , you should've went to school to see if you can fix it "" which  is reasonable , an hour or so later I pick up a bagels to eat , like rather small ones  so I eat one and take a bite out of the other and my mum walk in . Now before I continue I love my mother but shes just .... how can I describe it think of Lois from malcom in the middle but more neurotic,like the day I dont have to fear her screaming at me its gonna be fucking Nirvana , ill probably emulate Corpsegrinders Vermilion scream. Anyway she walks in and askes me "" Are you fucking insane  , do you realize that literally no one failed their finals in 40 years youre literally the only idiot who failed "" ( im not 3 people in my class  alone failed) "" How could you  fail ?!  Do you realize how embarrassed I am that you failed , what am I supposed to tell.everyone when they ask me about you! ""  now I try to tell her that I feel fucking horrid that I just wanna die all day  , and her response is basically "" HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL I HAVENT EATEN OR DRANK ANYTHING ALL DAY "" and insert  like a solid minute of yelling before I broke down in tears in front of her to which she responds "" STOP ACTING LIKE A NINE YEAR OLD  TAKE RESPONSIBILITY ARE YOU GONNA CRY WHEN YOU MAKE A GIRL PREGNANT TOMORROW"" and im just historically sobbing and she leaves to prepare for the gym while still yelling at me and I ask her "" please just leave me alone  "" I repeated that a few times and her response was "" OR WHAT YOURE GONNA HIT ME "" ( I have never raised my hand on any of my family with the intent to hurt , I have never hit my mom or dad nor intended or tried to the most ive gotten I playful fighting with my dad when I was younger , ill hit anyone who has intent to hurt me or kill me but I will not hit someone out of the blue, the last time I was in a fight was 5 years ago against my bully)and im just sobbing on the kitchen counter ans tell her ,that in not gonna hit her ,im not threatening her or anything simply asking her to stop, my dad walks in talks to me a bit and gives me honey and some water saying."" Take some honey and water youll get a fucking stroke"" so I pick up the spoon my hand is shaking like so much its insane and I drink the water ( my first water today!) And try to calm down  and before my mum goes to the gym she comes she comes to talk to me again"" I dont know what your problem with me is ,but I have your best interest in mind,and you're an addict to your phone, you have a problem you're an addict all you do is play games all day, you should've studied more , and prepared more instead of palying games "" at which point what am I supposed to say , anythinf denying is just gonna confirm it in her mind and I just tell her take me to the therapist if you think that's true snd she just packs and leaves 




In hindsight I should've studied and the fact that I failed is 150% on me , I felt confident enough that I could pass the same 5 subjects that ive been studying for 4 years , I have seemingly been proven wrong , that is no ones failure but my own , I can make excuses as to why it happened such as me.being scared shitless because the first two questions were something ive never seen , but even then that's on me . On the other hand I dont think calling me an addict is something adequate  , I have 4 games on my phone and.play 1,5 of them ( probably more but I fire up the GBA emulator once ina blue moon sooo) I really am not doing anything most of my time is spent reading , manga and books , sometimes comics ! And talking to my gf and friends ( of course take everything I say with a grain of salt since youre getting my perspective only and I might be terribly wrong with out realization) , I genuinely dont believe im too attached to my phone , if I had the ability to talk to my friends and gf another way that was just as accessible I do it ffs man I have messager installed  but not FB , I genuinely dont need it beyond updates for my school ,I literally use the easiest and cheapest way to talk to the people I like . For Christ's sake I regularly leave my phone behind when I go to my grannies and I dont have a second thought about , the thing I have on my mind is getting two.whiny old ladies of my back , but whatever maybe im just proving her point that im an addict by ranting so much about it so like who I have no idea 


And for the epilogue  : Twilight of the thunder god is an amazing Amon Amarth album


Anyway shout out to everyone here who cares to message me , leave a kind comment or show their care , and shout out to my  probably best friend for cheering me up and getting chocolate ice cream over her white dress , youre the real MVP youll be an amazing doctor <3",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

Then the day after Thanksgiving, 2016, I moved 5 hours away from my family and fiancée to take a job at a tv station.

The town was depressing in and of itself, with some of the highest heroin overdose and poverty rates in the state. Couple that with a shitty work situation and being just 23, I hit rock bottom.

I was keeping it mostly under control, and actually started seeing a therapist who helped quite a bit. But one day came where it was too much, and I was so stressed and broken from the thought of having to go to work and throw myself into a job that was so draining that I decided I was going to drive myself into a tree on the way over. I never self-harmed, I still could laugh and joke with friends, but I simply didn’t see the point of going on any longer.

While I didn’t tell my fiancée, she could tell something was wrong, and called my therapist. My therapist immediately sent someone from the services over, who helped talk me down. She called into my job to tell them I wouldn’t be coming in to work that day. 

That I was thankful for enough, but it was the reactions of those around me that moved me. When he heard what happened, my roommate (who worked at the same station and whom I had only met a few months before) rushed home immediately to make sure I was okay.

That night, my fiancée drove five hours in a snow storm to get to me, and spent a week with me, and got to meet my coworkers.

I ended up leaving the job two months or so later - a year ago since this past Tuesday. I moved back home with my parents for a few months, and now I’m back in the town where I went to college, working as an admissions counselor for my alma mater.

I married my wife last December, and she has been my saving grace. She is lovely, and funny, and smart, and so much more than I can ever hope to be. I entirely credit her with saving my life, and I never can tell her enough how much I love her.

People care about you. You just have to let them in.",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

One guy posted asking us, “My DM recently died from suicide, please put him in your games.” So I did. I was wtiting a short game at the time and I named it after this other DM. 
But I went a step further and I designed a dungeon whose every aspect, every chamber, represented a different mental illness or a mental health challenge. From the kobolds in my village being shunned (the way some people with mental illness are shunned) to the first room needing to be completed in a certain pattern (to represent OCD) to having my players run through a room full of traps (to represent the long, tedious, full-of-bullshit path some people must walk to even access mental health services), it was all about mental health. 

I named almost every NPC after classmates/friends I’ve lost to suicide, and simply remembering these people, some for the first time in years, brought tears to my eyes. Siro and Colleen and Nat and Julian and Preston and Nick and more.

If I could talk to them again, I’d say “Even if we barely knew each other, if you get another go-around and you have these troubles again, come find me and I will listen.” And to all of you now who need it I say PM me and I’ll listen. 

I will not report you to the cops or to mental health professionals who’ll just hold you and then slap you with a hospital bill you cannot repay.

I am not a licensed mental health professional.

I HAVE done mental health first aid training.

Nobody is going to read this since i'm so late  to the post but here it is anyways. I'm sick of having borderline personality disorder. I'm sick of my identity shifting from one day to the next. I'm sick of not being able to follow through with anything. I'm sick of being able to sleep for 24 plus hours straight. I'm sick of people who live full lives and who have never suffered  from mental illness telling me it's going to get better. Because it really hasn't. And even if it does for a little bit it's just going to get worse again. The lows make my life. The highs are extremely rare. There is no neutral. There is no middle of the road. 

Sometimes I think it's my right to take my own life. I'm the one who has to live it and I honestly don't want to anymore. 

This post is a nice gesture, but in my opinion, I actually think it's near impossible to tell when somebody is truly planning suicide. That's why news like this hit us like a ton of bricks. ",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

I remember being like 6 and telling my mom I wanted to be dead and didn’t really want to be here anymore. She told me that life is full of ups and downs and that I should never want to give up and then I remember her saying that once you’re gone, there is no coming back, people will cry and will be heart broken, they will always remember you but they will have to continue with their lives and move on. It was a dark reality as a child bot knowing why was scary. I was suicidal for years, not caring about myself. I had a pistol in my mouth more than I’d like to admit. I was the most fun guy at all the parties but dying inside. Sometimes cutting myself to feel something. 
Then it happened, a few years after high school my best friend, after being accepted at a big 10 college and getting scholarships, he washed his truck, cleaned his room and went and bought a box of hunting shells and blew his head off in a park a few miles from his house. No reason. No note. After They police asked if I knew who’s phone number was in his pocket. It was my new cell number. I was devastated and confused,hurt, mad and just sad. I still, to this day would will never forget that he could have just called me and talked. My depression got worse through out the years after loosing both my parents to cancer and my sister to an overdose 3 years ago. BUT I WILL NEVER GIVE UP. I WILL NEVER DO THAT WHICH WAS DONE TO ME.

Date and time picked out and everything.  I was in a place so dark that even the concept of light and joy were inconceivable to me. 

I was absolutely and utterly convinced that my family was going to be better off without me. That the world would be better off without me. If I had known a way to go back in time to ensure I had never existed I would have. 

My grandmother told me from a very young age that my birth was a mistake and that I was unwanted.  She told me I was unlovable and that if anyone ever told me they loved me it would be to use me.  This is something i still struggle with now even knowing it is absolute bullshit.  

I then reported my grandfather, her husband, for sexual and physical abuse at the age of 14.  I never lied about this or anything else that happened. I know now that this was the right choice. However, it tore my family and my world apart at that time.  My parents were great and supportive.  My father was absolutely crushed that his father was doing what he was. My mother was distraught that she had missed the signs. My grandmother called me an attention seeking whore and told anyone who would listen that I was a slut who had seduced him.  

Aunts and uncles tore me apart for airing family business and not allowing family to take care of it.  My brother was too young to understand what was going on and was very close to the grandparents so he believed my grandmother when she said I lied about all of it. 

I was 19 yrs old and planned to die on my 20th birthday. Figured it would save my parents some money if they got a head stone with fewer characters to engrave. 

I was killing a lot of time on the internet, chatting with strangers, taking stupid quizzes etc when I met a stranger who lived 3000 miles away from me through one of those quizzes. We started talking.  He asked how I was and how my days were, what I had done and what my plans were.  

A complete stranger took an interest in what I was doing and how I was doing.  I found myself sharing my story with him and he listened without judgment. I told him things I hadn't told anyone else and he listened without judgment.  I was never going to meet him so it didn't matter what he said. 

These conversations started to crack the shell of darkness around me and I began to see light again.  The thought of my impending suicide didn't bring as much comfort as it once had.  These conversations changed my perspective.  I was able to see that I was not the villain or the bad guy. I was able to see the pain and anguish these 5 years had put my parents and sister through. I could suddenly see the fear and anger and hatred (towards herself and her husband) that drove my grandmother's narrative.  

I should be clear that my immediate family were checking on me and were worried about me. They were expressing interest and concern but I couldn't see it. My depression was too deep. I know it would have caused a lot of pain and sorrow had I died then but in that place I couldn't see that. I thought my death would bring relief and peace.  I know better now.  

I met that internet stranger 4 months after we started communicating online. Married him 6 months after that. We're still married and have a 15 year old son.  Life isn't always easy and it would be a lie to say that suicide never occurred to me now. There are moments when I'm driving home and I think how easy it would be to drive off the road. I don't actually want to and wouldn't follow through but it happens. 

If you are still reading this, I guess my message is to reach out to strangers. Say hello. Ask them how they are and mean it. Be willing to be a friend or a shoulder if you find someone in need.  You never know if your hello will be the crack in their shell that lets the light back in.  I chose life because of a stranger's kindness. 

TL:DR: I planned to commit suicide on my 20th birthday due to some fucked up events in my life and terrible self image. An internet stranger asked me how I was doing and meant it. Saved my life. Now he's stuck with me. I chose life. Hardest choice of my life but I'm so glad I made the choice I did. ",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

It has really unbalanced my life. I don't ""blame"" him because he was emotionally unstable and mostly I feel sad he was so miserable that suicide was his only option. But I missed out on getting to know him and his sense of humor and his skills. There's so much I think we could have shared. I have a void where he could be. 

There's so much mental illness in my family. Dealing with my own has taught me that the biggest hurdle to getting help is often yourself. (There are often financial and access issues, too, I don't want to dismiss that.) 

I felt too guilty to reach out for so long.  I had my plan firmly in place. I was so lucky there were resources available to me. All I had to do was call my county crisis services. I wasn't shamed for reaching out. There are people who can help you feel like there is color in the world again. 

My life is so wonderful now. I've been able to come back from my lowest point and carve out a little slice of paradise for myself. I have gained so much for choosing to get help. ",Suicide Prevention Megathread,0

Start every day with 10 mins of meditation and it will help bundles in calming you down and allowing you to think rationally throughout the day. 

&nbsp;

EDIT: Well this blew up. My inbox is going crazy. Two things:

1) Yes, it's tough to start off with 10 mins of meditation. My point was that 10 mins is more than enough, so if you target that to be your ceiling, that's all you need. But meditation is ridiculously tough and much harder than people actually think it is, so as others have recommended, starting off with 2-3 mins and then building up isn't a bad idea.

2) I can definitely see people falling asleep during meditation. And initially, that's not even a bad thing because the whole point of it is calmness and clarity of thoughts. But if you push yourself a little bit consciously, you can maintain that clarity of thought even while you stay awake and keep yourself aware. Remember, inhale (1) and then breathe out (2). Then 3, 4, then 5, 6. Keep counting so that your attention is on your breathing and you will have a difficult time falling asleep but an easier time from there on focusing on something.

What this looks like is neck craning forward, slouching shoulders, belly sticking out, butt sticking out. Think of an S curve, you head is forward, shoulders back, belly forward, butt is back.

This will lead to back, knee, neck, shoulder, hip, elbow, even ankle pain. Basically, everywhere that can hurt may. 

Correcting this isn't incredible difficult and it takes about 30 minutes a day of light exercise and stretching followed by consistent use of good posture, when you nail it, you'll breath better and feel better overall. 

The #1 key is to learn to activate your glute muscles, best way to do this is to do glute-centric motions without weight so you can focus on exploring pathways that activate the muscle. This includes squats, good-mornings, glute bridges, and kick-backs. 

From here the other strengthening exercises are for the upper back, and the core. 

Prone cobras for the upper back, look up the position on google, very simple. Hold for 30-60 seconds, release. This is endurance training, aim for 3-5 ""reps"" of 60 seconds or so.

Next is planks. No cheating, make sure your tummy is tucked in and not drooping or you're not doing yourself any favors. 

After this, we want to do some simple stretching - Look up the ""Warrior Pose."" This will stretch your hip flexors and quads. This pull your hips down, while your abs pull up. We want the abs to win this fight, so stretch the quads, strengthen the abs. 

But stretching is the least important, most important is activation of the glutes, followed by developing a sense of how good posture 'feels' so you can return to it without a mirror.  ",What’s something small you can start doing today to better yourself?,0

Edit: brief explanation of this phenomena: the state of matter depends of the temperature and pressure and can be expressed by the following diagram(which is called a phase diagram):

(each matter has different phase diagram)

so given the pressure and temperature the matter, you can find its state (or phase) by the diagram.

the curves at the diagram are co-existence curves (which means that matter can be at 2 phases at the same time at a closed vessel - like liquid at the bottom of the vessel and gas floats above it)

there is a triple point (can be seen at the image above) at which all 3 phases can coexist - so at the right pressure and temperature you'll reach this weird phenomena.

In the 17th and 18th centuries American colonists found an overwhelming amount of lobster on the shore in giant mounds (sometimes up to a mans knees) there was so much of it in fact that a child could go down to the shore and come home with buckets full of dinner. People became sick of it and started feeding it to their farm animals while Natives used it as fertilizer. 


Due to this it gained a stigma being associated with poverty. The only people who ate it were slaves, indentured servants, and prisoners. A group of servants from Massachusetts actually sued because they were so sick of eating lobster and the courts ruled they would only have to eat it three times a week.
 

It wasn’t until the 1800’s this started to change because railway managers discovered if they charged for lobster as if it were a delicacy to people who did not know it’s disgusting reputation then people did actually like it.  By 1920 it becomes the food of choice for the worlds aristocrats.

Minor bit of background - I'm a straight guy with a lot of LGBT friends and was actively involved in supporting the Australian same-sex marriage campaign, so FB probably had me flagged as gay at the start of 2012. 

In 2012 I started dating someone. We'd been friends for some time. I'm on Facebook all the time, she had an account but almost never used it.

We basically never communicated on Facebook.

Immediately Facebook started telling me to mark her as a 'close friend' and all of its ads changed from ""Gay Singles Cruise"" and similar to ""Romantic Getaways for Couples"".

I can only assume that it was able to tell from GPS that she spent a night at my place, and that I spent one at hers a few days later.

Edit: A few guesses that wi-fi was involved.

Edit: For those interested in this man: [Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_\(slave\))

> Gordon, or ""Whipped Peter"", was an enslaved African American who escaped from a Louisiana plantation in March 1863, gaining freedom when he reached the Union camp near Baton Rouge. He became known as the subject of photographs documenting the extensive scarring of his back from whippings received in slavery. Abolitionists distributed these carte de visite photographs of Gordon throughout the United States and internationally to show the abuses of slavery.

> In July 1863 these images appeared in an article about Gordon published in Harper's Weekly, the most widely read journal during the Civil War. The pictures of Gordon's scourged back provided Northerners with visual evidence of brutal treatment of slaves and inspired many free blacks to enlist in the Union Army. Gordon joined the United States Colored Troops soon after their founding, and served as a soldier in the war.",What do you think is the single greatest photograph in history?,0

He is known as the possible identity of a man appearing in a 1936 photograph, conspicuously refusing to perform the Nazi salute with the other workers.[2][3] Landmesser had run afoul of the Nazi Party over his unlawful relationship with Irma Eckler, a Jewish woman. He was later imprisoned and eventually drafted into penal military service, where he was killed in action; Eckler was sent to a concentration camp where she was presumably killed.”

The Allies' policy of 'denazification' included a form of rehabilitation where German soldiers were forced to watch a film about about a concentration camp. Turning the camera from the footage onto the audience, you need only look at their faces to feel their grief and shame. I see it as a testament to our humanity, and that even those who have done the most heinous things don't have to be unreachable. For me it's a hopeful picture, that we can be better.

Friend group #1: The “joke” was when someone calls and asks who’s all there we would add Darrell to the list of names. Darrell wasn’t a real person. The joke wasn’t really funny, and made no sense out of context, but I guess that’s why it was an inside joke.

Friend group #2: I was hanging out playing some drinking games with a bunch of people that I hadn’t hung out with in a while. It was a kind of get together to remember a friend that they had who had recently died in a car accident. I didn’t know him that well, but I was always down to party. 

Anyway the phone rings, and the person who answered started listing off names. Sorting my cards for another round of Presidents and Assholes I offhandedly said “heh and Darrell!”. 

It was the typical record scratch moment where everyone stopped and looked at me. Darrell was the name of the friend who had just died.

This happened in 2002 and I still think about it all the time.","When you're lying in bed at night, do you ever randomly remember some relatively minor social missteps or poorly chosen words you did/said years earlier?

This Mexican family had just moved in and could barely speak any English and I befriended one of the kids my age in school. He came over to my place and we were both joking around about his bad English. Just doing what kids do. I would pretend to speak with his accent and then he would copy and it was silly, stupid and innocent. My mom told me I was being really inconsiderate and how uncool it was to make fun of someone for not being able to speak English. I felt terrible. The next day at school my friend came up to me and started joking with me again but I just shook my head and looked down at my desk in embarrassment. He had no idea what was wrong and I was too young and dumb to be able to explain my behavior to him.

As I grew older I spent probably 20 years thinking about that day and how much of a shit I was to be friendly one day and then without explaining anything just stop talking to him out of embarrassment. I felt really bad about it for a long time and often laid awake at night thinking about it. I ended up finding him on Facebook about a year ago and we friended each other so I told him how bad I felt about it and apologized. He just laughed it off and said it was no big deal and he was still really thankful to find someone as friendly as me when he didn't know anyone here. He said he figured my mom had said something to me about it and it never bothered him.

I don't know if maybe he was just being nice to me or not, but it was such a relief to hear it.

Thing is, I was so nervous that I spaced out for a bit and got lost in my overthinking mind, so I didn't hear the teacher's questions to my classmates. When it got to my turn, the teacher just said ""Now tell me about you"", assuming I understood what kind of information he was expecting. I just went straight into a monologue that started with ""So I was born in the South Zone of the city, but my mom decided to move to our current neighborhood a few months after divorcing my dad..."" And went on and on giving some very specific details about my short life. Everyone had a really confused look on their faces and as soon as I realized the teacher was also completely lost I stopped talking and went instantly red.

One of my coworkers was a guy my age who went to a different school. He was really cute, but he had a girlfriend who was away at college, and besides, I was in no position to date.

Meanwhile, ThE lOvE oF mY lIfE had broken up with me, but I didn't want him to know how much he had hurt me, so I was determined to have a date to the homecoming dance.

I thought of my coworker who was good looking and because he went to another school, no one would have to know my love life was crap and I had a friend take me to the dance. I asked him if he'd go with me, as friends, but somehow the wires got crossed and he thought I was actually asking him out.

After work one day, he asked if he could talk to me and he went into this long speech about how he has a girlfriend and he loves her very much and he can't disrespect her by going to the dance with me. All of that was fine--I wasn't mad or anything--except I'm a stress-laugher, and it struck me as funny that he thought I wanted to date him when the reality was that I didn't want to date anyone except ThE lOvE oF mY lIfE. Of course, all of that is difficult to explain as a mature adult, let alone a 17-year-old girl, so I just laughed.

My daughter was meeting a friend of hers before they both went to dinner with another friend of theirs for a birthday. They were about 14/15 at the time. I am walking my daughter towards the meeting place and we see her friend and friend's dad walking towards us from the opposite direction. This is on a busy mall area in front of a cinema complex. They run towards each other and start gabbing on like teenagers do, this is where the fun starts...


The friend's dad an I look at each other then burst out with a high pitched scream and run towards each other into an enthusiastic embrace. Some of the comments we made are as follows:


""OMG, you look fab!""
""Oh, it's all you bae!""
""What have you done to your hair? I LOVE it!""
etc...


We are both 35-40yo grown men carrying on about how good the other looks and all the rest of it. The blood drained from both daughters' faces and you could literally see them thinking ""just kill me now...""

- Fifty people are now known to have died

- 53 people were injured

- Officials said the killings were likely to be ideologically motivated, though there was no information that the gunman was associated with a particular group

- The suspect - Omar Mateen (dead), who was a US citizen from the Florida town of Port St Lucie and was of Afghan descent, was not on a terrorism watch list, although he was being investigated for an unrelated criminal act.



edit 2: How the incident unfolded

* The attack began at about 02:00 local time (06:00 GMT), said Police Chief John Mina.
* Pulse, which is one of the biggest nightclubs in Orlando, Florida, was holding a Latin-themed event that was nearing its end when a man opened fire inside.

* Shortly afterwards, the nightclub posted on its Facebook page: ""Everyone get out of pulse and keep running."" 
* Police sources have told US media the gunman was in possession of a suspicious device strapped to his body.
* There was an exchange of fire with a police officer working at the club, but it is unclear whether that was inside or outside the venue.
* A hostage situation developed and at 05:00 local time (09:00 GMT), officers stormed the building and detonated a ""controlled explosion"".

The shooter has himself barricaded inside Pulse with multiple hostages. This is per a private source.  Initial assessment and estimate was at least 20 red tagged patients per OFD.  They are prepared to take 20 trauma alerts at ORMC. Yellow and green tag patients will be welcome at florida hospital east.  Florida hospital orlando has taken on two red tags so far.  They have reached out to seminole fire and rescue and placed their units on standby. Orlando sounds like they are charge.  They just made ballistic vests available to the fire and ems first responders in the red zone. The walking wounded are walking to a treatment area behind Einstein bagels.   All that info is from a police scanner. And being updated as it happens.

3:23. Active fired shots outside ORMC.

3:50 they are having to pull OPD to a large gathering at Columbia.  Everyone get back in your houses.  Go home.  You are pulling resources for selfish reasons. 
3:56 they requested one more transport. So they have one more patient. It has really slowed down though. They just told someone to stage. 
4:19 they are being told they are expecting more patients who might be coming out right now. 
4:23 there are 8 patients coming out

Everyone is so concerned about the ethnicity and affiliation of the shooter. It's a bit ridiculous. There have been a lot of police, fire department, paramedics, and other heroes that served us today. And I bet you that you could find one white man and one Muslim among them. One Trump supporter, one Hillary supporter, one Bernie supporter, and one political apathetic. One person pro-gun rights, one person pro-gun control. Straight, gay, transgendered, etc. So stop your petty bickering and ""hoping"" for a certain outcome here.


If your immediate response to any tragedy is hope in the name of some agenda, your priorities are so far out of line. That's walking a gray area between a real human being, and a monster capable of committing this atrocity in the first place.

On Reddit and mainstream media, it's all about the terrorism aspect and possible ties to Islamic radicals. Yet on Twitter and Facebook, the debate hasn't even touched on these aspects of the massacre and instead it's focusing LGBT rights, discrimination, and homophobia within the United States. They're blaming this attack solely on discrimination  and homophobia, and entirely ommiting any religious causes. While I think both aspects can be attributed to the motive of this shooter, it's interesting to watch the way different online communities focus on different parts of the story/spin the story to focus on their views.

I'm appalled at the censoring going on at /r/news. Even if there is some Muslim bashing going on, So be it. Bash away because Islam needs to be a target of criticism until it stops leading to these crimes. It is sick that words are more harshly criticized than actions. Islam is not above criticism. More specifically, interpretations of Islam are not sacred. Why must we continue to tiptoe around Islamic beliefs and the violent rhetoric and actions that stem from those rotten roots? 

Even if Shia or Sufi Muslims and other Muslim minorities  aren't perpetrating these actions (and are often victims of them), it is good to scrutinize those beliefs, too. Especially when they lead to terrorism, human rights abuses, murder, violent rhetoric, etc. We need to keep talking about the elephant in the room or else we will never fix this sickness. For that reason and more, censoring is deplorable. 

It's as if there is a cancer that we can't talk about because we're superstitiously afraid it will make the cancer worse. No! When there is a cancer, you talk about it, you scrutinize it, you dissect it, you emotionally vent about it. We need to say ""Fuck Islam"" even if not all Muslims are to blame. Us Muslims need to say fuck Islam if it leads people to this over such things as homosexuality or drawing cartoons. How the fuck can this continue to happen? How can we continue to walk on eggshells about it? Death for having fun?! That's insane!

If the mods are deleting posts about donating blood and helping out, as I just read, that is even more disgusting and makes me absolutely sick to my stomach. What is going on? I can't wrap my head around the simultaneous violence in this event and the catering to a violent belief system that has been going on. 

Edit: I'd like to add, because in my venting I lost sight of the victims, my deepest condolences to them and their families.

I was just catching up with all of the content out there regarding this incident and finally watched the video of Obama's response to the attack. At a time when everyone's political and religious beliefs are more vocal than ever as it is election season something in Obama's response video struck me, and it struck me hard. 

Just off the left shoulder of President Obama stand the words, ""E Plubribus Unum"", which, for those who don't know means ""Out of many, one"". The sheer amount of division that has been happening in our country throughout the election season has been very troubling to me. Every day we wake up to news about riots, hateful comments from presidential nominees, and onslaughts of violence. It really makes you wonder, ""what the hell is going on?"" 

Now, I know this sort of stuff has been going on for a long time, but the most troubling thing for me is that the ONLY way we all can come together and truly live up to our nation's motto is in time of grief over an act of terrorism. Don't get me wrong, it is important to show those evil, despicable, hateful animals that the only thing they will do by committing these acts of terrorism is bring together a people that are becoming more and more divided as the election goes on, but how long will that last? How long will it really take before people start dividing again? It's not a question of ""if"", rather it is a question of ""when"". Time will pass, and people will put this event in their rear view mirrors and get back to hating those who oppose their views. We will all forget our motto and outcast those whose opinions differ from our own. 

The most beautiful part about our nation's motto is that it acknowledges that we are all different. A country that doesn't allow differing opinions is a country that will not prosper. We have plenty examples of this. What we need to do is figure out how to use this to our advantage to advance our nation and not divide it. 

I will end my rant at that. Again, I am sure this won't be seen, but if it does I hope that we can all do some self reflection about how we act when someone has differing opinions from us. It is too easy on a platform like Reddit to spew hatred because of the anonymity, but please think about what your words can do. Try to have an open mind about sensitive subjects. Try to remember that we are all in this together. There are bad people out there, and there always will be. Don't cast someone out because of their beliefs, because that is what causes extremists to act on their hatred. They think that they have to go above and beyond their normal actions to really make a statement. Do your best to understand that we are all human, we all have feelings, we all have the ability to love and be loved. I know that I am not innocent in this regard. I too am quick to defend my beliefs, and have probably hurt someone in the process. I have some self reflecting to do as well, and I hope everyone will join me in doing so. Take care of yourselves, everyone. Much love. ",[Breaking News] Orlando Nightclub mass-shooting.,0

I'm about to finish wrapping up my first ever seriously long form piece of writing. It's going to about about 160K all told. You may think to yourself, _'That's not too long, I can read a book that length in an afternoon.""_, or _'I can knock that out in a month or two, just writing a couple thousand words a day.'_, or _'You just tell a story and it all leaps out fully formed.'_

And you'd be wrong.

Writing, as enjoyable as it can be for author and audience, is a lot of work you just don't see. Yeah, you see the finished product, but what you don't see are things like drafts, discarded scenes, variant writings, conversations with editors, freewriting exercises, and all the just sheer ideas that come up and don't make it. I'd estimateI have easily spent more than a million words behind the scenes making this project happen.

It sound easy: you have a plot and you make it happen, starting at page 1, and do through to the back cover. A lot of my writing is somewhat out of order; starting from page 1 is honestly a snoozefest and chore -- I don't want to read the part of the fantasy story that's Farm Boy baling hay, and nobody really likes that part either unless they're a medievalist and the book goes full Tolkien about how that works. I have probably deleted 75% of all the words I've ever spawned for the product.

Beyond spewing words, there's tone to mind, characters to track, continuity, foreshadowing, building, managing tension, avoiding forcing cliches or stupidity, making imagery, dialogue that's nice to read and also you can imagine being spoken... And this has to all be managed under a word count that's enough for your reader to get the point without boring them or wearing your fingers to nubs.

Want to know how long it's taken me to write this thing? 2 fucking years. I've loved it, but hot damn, it was way harder than it looks when you just see the finished product and can just think I sat down one day and make it all come to life without complication.

It could be a hobby that you just can't see yourself not ever stop practicing because of how much joy it brings to you, like gaming, or handicrafts, or even your very job, but you must stop it because of other, more important and more immediate reasons. It hardly matters what is it about, and yet switching it off of your life will always be hard.

You think about it, and you play it out in your head then your stupid brain takes the worst possible response/outcome that could happen if you reached out and puts it front and centre on repeat. Any legitimate reaction or discussion is then hidden behind the thought of being ridiculed for weakness, mockingly point out your flaws, minimizing the situation etc. 

So then you hide it, you fake it and just cruise through the day on auto pilot until a week or two passes by and you consider it again. You repeat the cycle, continuously beating yourself up in your own head. If you're strong enough you deal with it for years, decades even. If you're not? It starts to manifest into the real world and starts to affect how you behave and how you interact with the world and others. 

Maybe you start to isolate yourself, fearing that the next conversation you have you might slip and say something that will let the cat out of the bag. You may even become hostile or domineering to people because that level of interaction is the easiest kind to get, or maybe it's just fun. Or in the worst case you turn to different substances to just make it go away for a while. 

You go through these motions over and over and over and over again but you just end up back at the beginning, thinking about how all the friends you went to school with are now married with kids and are buying their first homes, or are now really finding their rhythm with their careers and are starting to climb the ladders in their respective fields, maybe both.

Which is also why I rarely go to hotels now that I know the truth of how housekeepers treat them when they need to make their quota of rooms for the day. Ew gross lol. Some never changed the sheets!

Also it’s awkward as fuck to be in someone’s room making their beds and have the person walk into their room while I’m in there. Uh hey! Not stealing, seriously just making your bed I promise. They still always looked at me strange no matter what lmao.

Housekeeping man. That shit is no joke! Tip your housekeepers please. Many are working their assess off more than a lot of min. wage jobs and make almost nothing and get treating like nothing.

We all have maps of our time in school, how people treat us, all of our experiences. We also make maps about other people, we make assumptions about others based on what we see or hear. We get maps from others about us too, especially friends and parents. What they tell us we are, what we think they see when they look at us, what we think they think about us, etc etc etc.

People tend to focus on maps, and label themselves, pigeonhole themselves into roles and what they think they should do, feel, or be based on the maps that they have.

You are not a map. You are a 3D terrain of whatever beautiful biome you want to be. Don't stare at a map all day and forget too look up at what it really is.

There's a lot of people out there, all with a different opinion, and that's all it is, an opinion. They're all different, and you're never going to be good enough for all of them. 

The only person that has to live with you 24/7, is YOU. So the best thing you can do is be good enough for YOU. Be the person you think iis a good person, make dicisions that feel right to you, look in your heart and make decisions based on how that makes you feel.

It's a life long journey, and I've found more of myself than I could ever hope for. I'm confident enough now that I don't care too much about what others think of the choices I make, since they're not the ones who have to live with the aftermath of those choices, I am.

On top of that, if you behave a certain way, make certain choices, based on what others want, but not really what you want, you'll atract more people who like those choices, more people who agree with the choices you didn't even agree with yourself. If you make the choices YOU want to make, do things YOUR way, you'll atract more people who are like YOU, and you'll feel much better.

There were these high ideals that I always maintained and couldn't live up to them. Mostly because they were about saving the world and unattainable things like that. I spent an absurd amount of my teenage years studying philosophy and religion rather than dealing with teenage social issues like my peers. Ever since I was a kid, I had this goofy side though. When I wasn't pulling my hair out reading about semiotics, I would write silly stories to make people laugh.

When I went to college, things changed. I began exhibiting some really dangerous behavior patterns, especially for someone with a huge conscience like myself. The line between my public and private life got larger. I began feeling I could no wrong. I don't really want to list some of the things I did here because of shame. But suffice it to say, you would have all hated college me.

I'm going to skip to the end and just say this all got worse until I woke up one day and all my lightheartedness was gone. I was working a high paying meaningless job. I'd cheated on everyone I dated and thrown away every romantic relationship, some very painfully.

My life had become all about money, sex, and status.

The biggest epiphany of my life was realizing two things.

One, everyone goes through some form of this. We all try on different faces. If we find one that doesn't fit, we still tend to cling to it so that we don't have to change our current comfort level. This phase is normal and human.


Two, I was bipolar. Manic. My post puberty life was punctuated by periods of unbelievable energy and increasingly risky behavior. It put me on top - there were years where I had fans. I got up on stage and gave speeches and made people laugh and was the center of attention. And later it landed me in jail because the center cannot hold.

But with that diagnosis I finally was able to figure out my history and why I could never live up to those ideals. Because grandiosity is a textbook manic symptom too.

These days I don't push myself to do any more than love my family and enjoy the little things. I've lived more than most people do in a lifetime. I deserve a rest, at least for a little while.

Sorry this is so long.


The answer is that the normal cycle is to lose yourself for a little while and then find yourself again. Everyone has an existential crisis to some degree. You have to trust that this is normal and your real self is always there waiting for your return.

How you return, that will be unique. A death in the family, jail, overdose, failed relationship, financial loss, you name it. Something has to touch you deeply and it will happen. In the natural course of things we all take a big hit sooner or later.


I don't like to generalize but the 20s are a time when people tend to drift away from themselves. After that it's really anyone's guess when you'll come back.

But since you're asking this question, I say it will be sooner than later for you.","Have you ever felt you don't know/have forgotten who you really are?

Alan Watts talks a little about this in “The Book” - 

”We seldom realize, for example, that our most private thoughts and emotions are not actually our own. For we think in terms of languages and images which we did not invent, but which were given to us by society... Our social environment has this power just because we do not exist apart from a society. Society is our extended mind and body. Yet the very society from which the individual is inseparable is using its whole irresistible force to persuade the individual that he is indeed separate!

I'd also suggest meditating on the Buddhist idea of 'Anatta' which translates as 'no self.' You are in constant change and have no permanent essence or being. If you cling to the idea that you do have a permanent self, this is when you experience 'tanha' (craving), which then leads to suffering.

At your core, you are always the ""real you"". Sometimes the ""real you"" may go ignored, because of protective ways you have learned to cope with the world. 

After all, listening to and being the ""real you"" is exposing the core of yourself to the world - the good, the bad and the ugly. Sometimes we have got so used to protection our true selves, our true self doesn't get a look in.

This can also create a disconnect. Because we are hiding the ""real us"", we grow discontent with ourselves. We know that we are not being authentic. We try to envision what we wish we could be, and because we are discontent, we may instead imagine an ""ideal self"". We view this ""ideal self"" as what we would be, if we just tried hard enough - if we didn't let petty things get in the way of being ""true to ourselves"" - but in reality, we are not the ""ideal self"".

And it's often the straining to reach the idea of some kind of ""ideal self"" that prevents the ""real you"" from being appreciated, listened to, validated, honored. 

We berate ourselves for not reaching that ideal. We dislike the ""real self"" because the ""real self"" is not the perfect ideal.

To reach the real me, I have to let go of the ideal me.","Have you ever felt you don't know/have forgotten who you really are? That you've spent years just adapting to surroundings to make life easier and don't know what's the real you anymore? If so, how did you overcome this?",0

It is a book about a man who has forgotten who he is, and has spent years (decades) adapting to surroundings but not being the real him. 

To spoil the message (given in the prologue of the book), we are what we pretend to be, so we must be very careful about what we pretend to be. 

This idea of a real/forgotten us is both an illusion to ourselves and irrelevant to the people around us. What you've done to adapt is who you really are. Even if it's just adapting, it's still the actions you take. It is how you respond to situations. What you do in these moments of adaptation are still your actions. 

The moral of this book and the story it uses to tell it have helped me out a lot during episodes of existential angst, and for that, I highly recommend the book. In a meta-philosophical spin, I can interpret it as a call to live an authentic life. You haven't forgotten who you are by way of adapting, the real you has simply adapted to living in-authentically. This adaptation is an incredibly easy thing for humans to do, so it shouldn't be a cause for existential angst; at least, don't beat yourself up over it. 

Make a change. Any change. You are what you do, even if you are pretending, so do something that makes you happy, even if it's just a hobby.","Have you ever felt you don't know/have forgotten who you really are?

Accept that you are different each day, and do so joyfully, recognizing it for the gift it is.

By no means am I a doctor, but grounding techniques can help if you're feeling this way. Such as:  

- Do something that causes physical sensations like holding an ice cube, touching something soft, or washing your face.
- Say facts out loud, such as my name is ___ I am ___ years old and live in ____
- Listen to familiar music that makes you comfortable, or turn on a movie you've seen often
- Light incense or a candle and focus on the smell
- Point out and focus on certain items in your immediate area

First of all sorry for formatting, on mobile and writing this on the way out the door to a Dr.  Appointment.

I felt a little like that a few years ago.  I decided one day to start paying attention go the feeling you get in your gut when you express your beliefs.  

If you don't know what I'm talking about it's a philosophy thing.  Basically, you know that uneasy feeling you get in your stomach and heart area when you are arguing about politics with someone? You aren't supposed to feel that.  That feeling is only presant when you are just repeating something someone else said because it sounds good to you and you don't actually believe it.  You might think you agree with it but you didn't come to that understanding on your own and don't feel secure in what you are saying because there might be holes in the idea that you don't know about.  If you have made your own opinions without hearing them somewhere else first, (or at least you didn't start with a preformed openion.) You just won't feel that uneasiness at all.  It's truly enlightening to suddenly realize that most of your openions aren't actually you own.

Once you learn to pay attention to that feeling, you can start forming yourself based on what you really think about different stuff.  Now days I'm the kind of person who will be the only person in a whole room to say ""Wait, I don't think that's right."". And the reason is there is so much less stress about being wrong or shunned because if that happens I will know that at least I had the courage and strength to stand up for what I believe in. 

Also, I would like to say that I disagree with top comment guy.  If he just means that you adapt things like you dress and accent and what not, fine.  He's right in that case.  However, in my opinion you should NEVER allow yourself to be pressured into thinking something just because that's what a bunch of other people are saying.  If you do, then in that moment you have given up one more little piece of who you are.

Lastly, I used politics as an example in this because that's usually where people are most familiar with the feeling I'm talking about.  This feeling is part of many aspects of life.  If you've ever been unsure of what the old expression ""Trust your gut."" Means, now you know.","Have you ever felt you don't know/have forgotten who you really are?

But I think the roots of this issue run deeper than ""years"" like your question implies. The subconscious mind is formed before the age of 7, and then it forms the basis for how we interact with the world whenever we're not fully present (which apparently is up to 95% of the time, according to some psychologists).

Kids are super intuitive and highly attuned to their parents emotions -- even if they're not explicitly told to behave a certain way, kids often act in a way that gets attention and affection from their parents. Also, many kids are taught that they are responsible for their parent's emotions. Stuff like, ""Don't run in the house, you'll make your dad mad."" So many kids learn early on that they cannot be their authentic selves; they are conditioned to behave differently.

If you've forgotten who you really are, or you've never known who you really are, spend time doing ""inner child"" work and then ""reparenting"" yourself to give your inner child what you need and to celebrate your unique, authentic self.

If you've identified areas you'd like to improve, spend time intention setting (actively set intentions on what you want), visualizing who you want to be, ""future self journaling"" and writing/saying affirmations. Make your affirmations positive, about who you want to be. For example, if you'd like to be less defensive in your daily interactions, you might say, ""I am calm"" and ""I can understand perspectives besides my own."" (It's difficult for your most basic mind to grasp the absence of something, so it's much harder to internalize and conceptualize a statement like ""I am not emotionally reactive"" than ""I am calm"")

These things aren't easy and they require daily effort, but they're not mumbo-jumbo either. Elite athletes use the techniques of visualization and intention setting all the time. They believe they can win, and they visualize what that will look, smell, and feel like.

I should note that all of this is easier when your body is relaxed and not in a state of constant stress and inflammation. Things that help are: healing your gut (eliminate processed foods, as well as antibiotics and NSAIDs), diaphragmatic breathing, cold-water immersion (cold showers), good sleep hygiene, and exercise.

Long story short, For a long time I just skated through each day trying to just keep my head down and see tomorrow. Got diagnosed with depression, and my girlfriend of nearly 4 years ghosted me after the diagnosis.

Decided instead of seeing it as rock bottom of being lost and not knowing who I am or want to do, I saw it as a challenge. Left my job last night and plan to travel to another country next week and stay long term with a friend there. But you can just as easily find a hostel that’s hiring somewhere and they may offer free accommodations for staff. 

Went from not knowing who I am or what I want to do, being depressed and abandoned by my long term girlfriend, stuck in a 12 hour night shift factory job, to being on top of my world and excited for who I can yet become.

I stood at the top of the stairs and just sort of had this realization that this was it. I’ve reached the end of my cycle. From now on it’s as if I am on the rails of a rollercoaster. Things might get exciting at times but you know where you’re going and you can’t get off. 

I thought about my dreams and what I wanted to be. I realized that I didn’t have anything like that anymore. I can’t even remember what I wanted to be. Maybe a lawyer, but I accomplished that. Honestly the idea of being a lawyer was always some amorphous goal that never really had any meaning behind it. Another expectation to be strived for and accomplished with no joy behind it. 

I know that I have things in my life that matter to me. Mostly my family. But even if I was gone those things would continue. My wife is the far better parent and I am at best the second choice for the kids. 

I’m not sure I’ve ever known who I really am. Maybe no one does. Maybe that’s the meaning of life,  the constant search for the moment when you meet the “real you”.  I hope he likes me if I ever run into him.

I was working overtime to support my wife and daughter and the weight of bills and others things kept me in a state where I was just not content with anything. I was always worried about our financial position and what was next. I didn’t really focus on what was happening then. We really weren’t bad off by any means, I was just over exerting myself trying to get us to a position where we wouldn’t have to worry about anything. 

Well, I missed things. I ended up deploying and when I got home I knew I needed a change. Me and my family moved and I’m currently in school full time. We are getting by, but I am really focusing on myself and trying to enjoy things again. Honestly, it’s been pretty great. It helps that my wife and daughter are an amazing support system.

I don’t think you ever outgrow it. Once you hit mid-to-late 40’s, you still have those same feelings, but because you look older, and yet still feel like a kid version of yourself inside, you are constantly second-guessing yourself, thinking things like, “Can I still say silly things at my age? Can I giggle? Can I still do an impromptu cartwheel on the front lawn?” (I’m here to tell ya, ixnay on the cartwheel.) I have no idea how to be an older, “appropriate” version of the kid me, so who am I? Well, not very mature at this point. But maybe that can be a new thing: Oldish people not forcing themselves to be someone else’s idea of “mature adult. “

My point is: Be whatever you feel like being. Don’t think about it. Just do it.

Finally I'm free to live my life, here, in this _real_ reality. I've been given a gift, I can start again, taking what I learned from the experience to better myself and others. This life was indistinguishable from the simulation, but still I will choose to live with the dignity of knowing my life is truly my own again.

I take a moment to examine myself. I touch my fleshy fingertips to the scales of my foul flesh. A large sack of fat tissue encompasses my body. Oh, no. How long was I in there... And this, what is this, I ask, as I yank the tubes from my swollen red arm. What happened to me? This is what I really am, huh... I'll just have to turn some things around, I can do it. I take a look at my surroundings. I'm in a miniscule room, with nothing but my chair and a metal door. This is awful, have I really been plugged in this whole time... A little exercise will help. I try to pull myself up to my feet, but end up simply pulling myself into the cold, filthy carpet of my dwelling. My legs, oh my God my legs are gone... I examine them, they've been amputated. I try so hard to remember the time before the simulation, but it's no use. That was so long ago... Right? 

I try to remember, a family? A friend? Anyone... I drag myself to the door and push it ajar. The sight I behold is difficult to describe. To the left and right of my chamber, is a line of others that stretch as far as I can see... And beyond that, is nothing. Collapsing buildings. Dried up river beds. Mounds of garbage left to decay, leaving only the non-degradable filth behind. Dirt devoid of grass, or life for that matter. There is no one. It's pitch black. Only an enormous, rubbled Moon reflecting a blinding light... From the sun?

I stare in awe and horror. Then, the ambient temperature begins to rise very quickly. I easily break a sweat. Peeking over the horizon, is the sunrise.

I watch as Earth's sun raises itself above the jagged horizon of derelict buildings and craters. The sun slowly encompasses the entire sky, easily a thousand times larger than it should be. It's blood red.

As my skin begins to blister painfully, I drag myself back inside as quickly as I can and I slam the chamber closed.

I pull myself into my seat and slip the goggles on again.

which brings up a really solid discussion. is it worth spending 6k-30k a year to keep 5 family from getting benefits?  

I'd argue first that, no, these people probably need the assistance the most, it's very anti-christian (even though they push for this the most), it reinforces stereotypes that people on assistance are lazy/stealing/whatever you want to call these people to somehow justify that they are not worthy of our compassion.

this is one of those laws that hurts people? It more or less boils down to the law makers think they need this law to protect the interests of people not on welfare.

Its not socio-economic inequalities, not racial discrimination, not cyclical poverty especially in urban areas, not lack of education or job opportunities, not lack of support for betterment. Nope, just lazy people trying to scam the system. Let's call them out!!! Even if it costs more money than just feeding that person. Good plan....good plan.

Government assistance should always be given based on need rather than merit. Merit based aid is a very slippery slope. What criteria are you going to evaluate whether or not someone is deserving? Who gets to make that determination, and what gives them the right to judge? Merit is far too subjective.

Need is much more easily quantified. Does someone have enough to eat? Do they have shelter? Do they have access to critical healthcare? Sure, people have varying opinions on what is and what isn't critical, but I think reasonable people agree that no one should be left to die from preventable/treatable diseases. Can you provide these things to your family?

I think withholding assistance based on your moral assessment says a lot about the person doing the withholding than any type of moral lapse. Furthermore, this type of policy has the potential to exacerbate drug abuse (and almost certainly will).

* The drug tests actually catch people. There are now a bunch of people, plenty who already have issues with addiction or mental health problems for which they self-medicate, some just poor, who can't afford food. They'll get desperate, people will get hurt.
  * Also in this scenario, these people's kids will suffer. The proposed law allows a family member to receive the benefits on behalf of children, but this is still adding a burden and you know the parents will also be eating this food too if it's in their house. So basically puts a burden on the families of those caught and takes food away from kids.
* The drug tests don't catch anyone. But they add a burden to getting food stamps. Not as many desperate people as the first situation, but makes it more difficult for people to get out of poverty depending on how inconvenient the testing is.

Addiction is an issue in poor communities (as it is in middle class and rich communities), but people who can't afford food often can't afford drugs with any regularity either.  Plus, if such a law went into place, well....drug users are often capable of taking breaks long enough to get jobs that drug test, so people would just do that when their drug test was coming up.  It's also more expensive than the cost of just letting the drug users get food stamps.  I'm not sure which drug tests would be used, but many of the common ones also only test for certain drugs (marijuana in particular, though of course other commonly used drugs), and some drugs stay in a person's system longer than others.  *If* (big if) it was effective in any way, it would just bar a lot of casual marijuana users while failing to catch habitual users of more expensive or harmful drugs.

Beyond the fact that it's not practical, it's also pretty cruel.  Starving drug users, whether casual or addicts, isn't going to deter them, and will create additional health problems.  Plus, many food stamp users have children.

My wife, my kids, my friends, the home I built... they're all gone. It would feel like my sons died. I would still feel the way the older one climbs into my lap when he's having a bad day. The blissful belly laugh of my infant is imprinted on my heart. And now those don't exist anymore. I would remember my wedding, and the Mexico vacation where the oldest was conceived, and not know how to comprehend that as a 12 year old kid who is barely even discovering porn. 

And I'd be 100% isolated in my grief. It would be over 2 decades of reality in my mind, and anyone I talked to about the death of my family would remind me that it's all in my mind. A 12 year old isn't equipped to handle that. I'd probably get placed into psychiatric therapy, placed on mind-numbing medications. Adult me loves beer and scotch. I bet pre-teen me would drown himself in adolescent alcoholism to try to forget. 

I would certainly try to find my wife. But her nomadic childhood and 1995 technology would make that virtually impossible. It would be years before social media or even an email address would exist. By then, I'd probably come to the realization that I don't exist to her anyway, and any attempt to bombard her with my crazy would be abusive. 

Eventually, I'd come to accept that it's all fake. I hope I wouldn't struggle with wondering if anything else is real. How do you know what to believe when 2/3 of your life was a fabrication of your own mind? The emotions would never go away. But I'm resilient enough to let the dream become a precautionary tale. I'd know what could go wrong with certain decisions, and the consequences would be much more real than any warning from someone else. I'd absolutely take a more determined career pathway. Meet and fall in love with someone else, and know the tendencies in myself that can erode a relationship. I'd start a new family, and struggle with not comparing my ""real"" kids to the ones I remember from a dream 15 years ago...","What if you suddenly feel a touch on the shoulder following with the words: ""are you sleeping during my class?"".

Right at the end of grade 7, beginning of grade 8, my life went completely upside down. Parents divorced. Social workers and child services got involved. Police got involved. Years of therapy and counselling and psychologists. Moved around a lot. Mom took us to live in women shelters for a while. Problem is they didn't like me in the shelters cause I'm male and I would hear comments about how terrible I would grow up to be. Later on we had to use food banks. Lived in a cockroach infested run down townhouse. Had the power shut off several times. Mom, almost immediately, got remarried to a guy who was just as bad if not worse than my dad. Got beaten regularly by him. Nobody believed me and my siblings shunned me for it. Family moved across the country. Lost friends and family. Lost my chance at the education I wanted at a specific school. Years of stress and anxiety and abuse caused me to not be able to socialise properly, as well as made me have a difficult time learning making me fall behind. Tried to self teach for years but it only made things worse. Suffered from panic attacks for years where I would throw up daily for months on end. Any friends that I made just disappeared eventually, usually telling me to stop feeling sorry for myself, or get over it, people have it worse, ect ,ect. Just overall so much stuff to deal with over the last decade or two.  


I do not feel good about living, do not feel good about anything that I do. Always feel tense, anxious, and scared I would LOVE, JUST ABSOLUTELY LOVE, to just wake up in grade 7 and find out it was a dream.

I worked for carnival for 5 years, specifically in debarkation. Additionally, I worked for Disney Cruise Line and Princess Cruise Line. 

Here’s what happens: We give you a card upon check in and that card is scanned the minute you step on board. Additionally, it is scanned when you leave the ship for either complete debarkation or excursions.

At the end of your cruise, debarkation starts around 7:00AM. Come 10:00AM we receive a list of people who have not yet had their card scanned. (It’s impossible to get off the boat without getting your card scanned, unless you jump into the water, haha).

Then a manhunt begins to get you guys off the ship so we can put a new 2200-2600 people on it. 

We do not start boarding new passengers until every card from the previous voyage has been scanned.

In my experience, nobody ever waits and tries to hide. If you do take a cruise, book a flight that’s a little bit later in the morning and go with the latest check out time you can.

So many people aim for debarking around 7:00-9:00AM. Literally over 1700 people will be waiting in lines that’ll take well over an hour to get out of. Instead of waiting in line for the hour, stay onboard and eat some breakfast, take some last minute photos, and then when your time comes just leave, go through customs, and be on your merry way.

I’m the one-stop redditor for all cruising tips, haha.

Guests who take forever to leave suck.  Employees of the ship can’t leave until every last guest has existed the vessel. So if a guest is taking their time to leave or hiding, they are potentially keeping over a hundred employees from going home.

A guy I met in line assumed I didn't speak English, and he was telling his friend that they needed to smoke all of their weed because they heard that the border agents in Greece were strict. We became fast friends. I had booze too. I was going to sleep in the open air on the deck, but a French Canadian girl with a mustache kept trying to crawl into my sleeping bag with me and do the nasty (I'm a guy btw). It finally came to a point where I knew my only chance to get some sleep and get away was to rent a room, so I went and paid the extra money for a room to Corfu, they were going to wake me up when we reached port. I wake up and the pursers are knocking on my door. So I let them in and say ""Corfu?"". No. they say. I was a bit annoyed. Why the fuck are you waking me up if we're not at my port? I try to convey that, and then they say ""No Corfu"". Huh? ""Corfu gone"". Whaaaaat? I find myself being escorted up to some obviously policey kind of office with the pursers looking angry at me, but I finally get to somebody that speaks English and start ripping them for not fucking waking me up! 

I guess they didn't like my attitude because I was booted off on mainland Greece with no way to get to fucking Corfu. With a raging hangover. And I'm about to shit my pants. I start asking around the port how I can get to Corfu and where I can find a bathroom. Some random Greek guy took pity on me and helped me out, and suddenly realized that a rust bucket that was just about to leave was heading there! I rush over and pay, and it's not a tourist boat, it's the boat the locals take to work on the island. I make a beeline for the head, and a dude stops me. No using the bathroom while in port. I have to wait until they get past the breakwall. 

At this point my clinch muscles have been getting a good hour or so workout, I'm sweating profusely, and the hangover is really kicking into high gear. I curl up in the fetal position next to the big cowl vent until we're nearing the breakwall and I head towards the head. We finally pass, and the dude opens the door. You know that sense of relief you get when you're finally at a bathroom after more than an hour of clenching? It was palpable. I get into the bathroom and I'm hit with a wall of hot stench. No worries. I can do the old curl the upper lip trick to close my nostrils. I'm on a mission. I open the stall door and... No toilet. This is Greece. It's a hole in the shit covered floor with two spots for your feet.

Now at this point, something in the back of my brain is wondering why there is shit all over the floor. But too many other things were going on in my brain at the time that I simply chalked it up to the Greeks having prehensile anuses. 

And that's when the waves hit. My pants are down, I'm bending down to do the squat, and I hear it. Glurg glurg glurg glurgglurgglurgeglurghligligrglglrglrgg. Now since I had just begun the squat my eyes happened to be perfectly aligned with the hole. And there I see a black liquid mass working it's way up from the deep like an angry creature from the Earth's core. Those thoughts from the back of my brain come rushing forward into the spotlight! Now I'm strongly suspecting that the Greeks, well at least most of them, don't have prehensile anuses! There is a perfectly valid reason that there is shit all over the floor and I was witnessing it! I pulled my pants up and burst out the stall just as the morass arose from every stall, nipping at my heels as I skipped over the bulkhead and out the door. 

I returned to my fetal position on the bow. Clenching and shivering for the three hour trip to Corfu.","Redditors who have tried to hide on your cruise when it ended so that you could stay on the ship for the next round, how did that go?",1

When we split up he said he was messed up mentally about it (if THAT'S your excuse then okaaaaaay...) so he went on a single's cruise with his buddy. The problem was, he was in his early 30s and everyone else was like 45 plus. The cruise isn't helping his mood at all until they land in Jamaica and him and his buddy take a taxi to some bar in the bush. There he meets a pretty girl, wins a game of pool, life feels good again.

They hear the warning signal for the cruise so they get back on the boat. My ex was shook and didn't want to continue, so he put important documents in a plastic bag and **jumped off the boat**. Although he's a newfie, he swims like a rock and Jamaican authorities had to rescue him. Then they questioned him for 24 hours (are you sane, do you have money to get home...) until he was able to call the bar chick he had met to verify his story. They released him and gave him 3 weeks to visit/play on the island.

It turns out that he helped some rich guy out who rewarded him with a ticket for the cruise ship. The captain wasn't too pleased because he looked kinda scruffy and this was a nice looking ship.

The captain let him stay but he was only allowed to use the facilities at night and had to sleep in a maintenance room. The cruise was quite big so he had quite a lot to choose from, there was a casino, a restaurant, a mini golf course, a bingo hall but this man chose to go in the swimming pool. 

He had never been in a swimming pool before but he saw the diving board and thought he would give it a go. Turns out the guy is a natural, he is so good that the captain was beyond impressed and wanted to showcase him to the guests. 

The captain let him stay there for a few months to practice and to entertain everyone however it wasn't enough for the captain, he wanted it to be bigger and better everytime. One day the captain decided to make the diving board much higher which didn't seem to bother Harry much.

The big day comes around and this thing is tall, and I mean TALL. Harry was a little bit intimidated but he decided to go along with it anyway because he finally had somewhere to stay. He began to climb what he described as a never ending ladder to heaven. Halfway up he noticed that he could no longer see the swimming pool and that the clouds and seagulls appeared to be closer to him. He finally reached the top and took the dive knowing full well that he could completely miss and die. 

He dived perfectly. No splash at all. However because of the velocity at which he was going at he went straight through the floor of the pool, piercing through several floors. Past the casino, past the tennis court, past the golf course, past his bed roll, until he went straight through the ship itself. Everyone thought he had died but after five minutes he resurfaced, much to everyone's disbelief.

The captain couldn't believe it and wanted to know how Harry had done it, to which Harry responded:

Typically, debarkation would be a 3-4 hr process (I worked on the larger vessels). Guests would be scanned off the ship using their 'sail and sign' card(fancy term for on board debit/credit card). As guests are scanned off of the ship their name is checked away from the manifest. Any remaining names are then called over the shipboard PA system until they are either found or confirmed to be in the customs queue. A security sweep is completed on each deck, checking all bathrooms, crew only areas, open decks and guest cabins. Guest cabins are typically swept by housekeeping staff. Each member of the security team is given a physical list that they must carry with them from location to location until the entire ship has been swept (with exception to sealed areas such as the engine control and access, and the bridge).

Any guest not making an active effort to vacate the vessel or attempting to stow away on the vessel is arrested and escorted off of the vessel by whatever law enforcement agency has jurisdiction in that harbor or port. I've only ever seen it happen once, and it is not pretty. You're taken forcibly off of the ship to a holding area, get questioned, searched, your belongings get searched, and you can be held for up to 24 hours. Followed by fines and I could only assume court appearances.

The other things that you might not think of if you're attempting to stow away is the effect you have on everyone else. Cruise ships unload one cruise and load another the same day. Delaying that debarkation process keeps those people sitting/standing in the hot sun. This is typically upwards of 2000-3000 people for larger ships. You also slow down the customs line as they will pull an agent or two for the questioning and ensuing paperwork. The attempt can delay debarkation, embarkation, and sail away for several hours. In other words, a would be stow away can delay someone's vacation and have it off to a rough start because they want to be selfish.

Please, when you leave your cruise, be kind a courteous to the crew that's helping you that morning, wait for you're debarkation zone to be called and when it is, try to say thank you to at least one crew member before you leave and dont be afraid to give them a hug. Most people that work on cruises dont see their family for upwards of 6 months and never have days off.

You are given a plastic card that is swiped when you get on board with your picture taken.  To board or disembark the ship, you need to hand that card to a security guard - it makes a bing noise and the original gangway picture you took comes up on the screen.  

This will seem drawn out but just go with me:

Step 1 - Decoy disembarking the ship

In order to stay on the cruise ship an addition cruise, at disembarkation (the end of the cruise), someone (lets call him decoy) would need to pretend to be you (looking like you as well), be checked off the ship with your luggage (you could keep a small backpack but anything larger would be noted as suspicious), walk out of the secured dock area and then SOMEHOW get back onto the ship.

Before getting off the ship, the decoy would need to check in with their muster station (where you go if there is an emergency) and get checked off by a ship employee and wait for his group to be allowed to leave the ship.

This may seem like an easy task but the decoy would THEN need to slip into the secured docking area, dress like the shoreside team (they have specific uniforms and ID badges that pass through security) then get past all the existing security that checks the badges of everyone who comes on or off the ship in the area of on/off loading food/trash/ etc.  There is guards at every security entrance and cameras, so you would need to be disguised beyond recognition as well from the trip you just took on the ship.

Then the decoy would need to slip undetected by security back up to their room, get their things, check in at the muster station, then get off the ship as a regular guest with their own card.

If you were to do all these things, congrats - step one is complete.

Step Two - Hiding on the ship during embarkation

There is a few hour period between when the last ship passenger gets off and the new passengers arrive.  During this time, the ship is cleaned front to back.  The passenger would need to dress like an ship employee (including name badge and any company mandated pins as well).  Depending on the position you are faking to look like, this may not line up with your nationality (an American or Canadian Caucasian could not dress like a room steward, as most are from the phillipeans or an eastern european country).

If you tried to engage in a specific job, the crew members would rat you out to their management, as new crew/passengers had not arrived on the ship and most everyone knows who works there because you are stuck with those around you.  Your best bet might actually be to hide in a cabin that had been fully cleaned out and was ready for new tenants.  That would be a risky move to try and make because of the cameras in the hallways and timing how to get into the room while it is open without the room steward seeing you go into said room.

Step Three - Passengers arrive on the boat

Here is probably the most tricky part of the cruise.  Once passengers get on the ship, they start drinking and eating.  The same people you saw last cruise will be greeting you at the buffet, cruise staff welcoming you to your muster station, and shop staff trying to sell you perfume/watches at ""severely discounted prices"".  If a crew member recognizes you, they will probably make a comment or start a conversation with you about how you're doing 2 cruises in a row.  If this arises any suspicion, a crew member will tell security and they will request your room card you received on embarkation.  If you cannot provide it - you're busted.

At this point, your only option is to eat at the buffet when it is open.  You have your clothing / what's in your backpack to rely on but if you want specialty coffee, higher end food, alcohol, or to charge something to your room, you have no ability to do any of those things.

Step Four - Sleeping arrangements

As you have no cabin to sleep in or ability to get specialty food, you now can enjoy the ship minus those things you'd need a cruise card for.  It's unlikely you'll have enough changes of clothing to keep in line with anything besides the casual nights (no formal, tux, etc evenings).  You then need to figure out your sleeping arrangements.  There is always the possibility you can find someone to invite you back to their cabin but most are double or quad occupancy.  You do not have any card to try and woo then with alcohol, gifts, etc because everything is tied to your ship card.

If they do invite you to their room, their will become suspicious after night 1 of the fact that you don't go back to your room or that you're by yourself this entire time.

The other option is knowing someone who is cruising the following week and bunking with them, but this is unlikely.

Step Five - Leaving the ship

You may dock in amazing ports like mexico, alaska, or europe but you cannot get off the ship without one of those ship cards.  The only way to facilitate this would be to wait until you are at your final destination, dress as a shore side team member, and try to get past ship security - past shoreside secured area security, and home free.

Conclusion:

If any of this does not dissuade you from trying to hide on a ship past your original cruise, just know that if you are caught at any point, you will be put into the ship's jail and you'll released to the local police at the next available port.  You'll face severe jail time including fines and being banned from cruising with that cruise line for the rest of your life.  You'll make national news and will probably lose your job and respect of your friends.

I've never heard of anyone being successful at this with the exception of a bird that got caught in a room and went from the Caribbean to Florida by accident.

TLDR: Don't fucking try it unless you are a super ninja that has a dedicated team to support you and have no fear of jailtime or being made an example of by the cruise industry with your brazen stupidity.","Redditors who have tried to hide on your cruise when it ended so that you could stay on the ship for the next round, how did that go?",0

The only stow-away story I've got is when I was going through Tech School in Great Lakes, Illinois.  We had a 2 year undesignated fleet returnee, which usually means he or she joined without having a job lined up, for whatever reason.  This also means that you're going to be given the worst jobs on the ship while you're 'finding out' what job you want.

Anyway, he was a nice guy, but definitely had that I've been in the shit and you haven't mentality, and I'll give that to him.  As a fleet returnee he was also given privileges and was well liked and respected.  We all stayed in the barracks on base, and it was very dorm like.  We had regular inspections, had to keep things clean, etc.  They generally didn't check our closets that each had a door with a handle, which led to people hiding their during morning PT, and also getting caught doing this.  

He was caught with a pet rat in his closet.  Not super weird, I guess; a pet is a pet.  But I'll never forget the sullen, hostile, entitled and defensive look in his eyes, nor the tone of his voice, as he told the room of E3 and below recent boot camp graduates that, ""This rat has more sea time than all you mother fuckers.""  He really loved and doubled down on that rat, admitting he had it out at sea lol.  I honestly don't know what happened to the rat, but the guy ended up transferring to a different job on the base.","Redditors who have tried to hide on your cruise when it ended so that you could stay on the ship for the next round, how did that go?",0

I was on a three week cruise through the Bahamas. Hated life, my now ex wife, my job.  We stopped at the island of Nassau, where we could get out and tour for the day. My wife stayed back on the ship, as we had gotten into an argument and wanted nothing to do with eachother. We were instructed to be on that boat by the end of the day, so after a couple of hours at a tiki bar, I headed back. I didn't want to go back, it was paradise. When I got on the ship, they checked me in, because when I exited the boat, they checked me out. I then headed to the stern, half drunk, and jumped off of the boat as soon as we left the wharf. See, there arent beaches next to the wharf, it's a residential area. The houses are right on the water. There is, however, a small landmass in front of the wharf. I realized that I probably wouldnt be able to go up onto the main island, so I headed for the land mass. I got up onto the beach of the landmass, exhausted, but happy, nonetheless. I guess my wife told the staff, which told the higher-ups on the ship, who contacted the Nassau authorities. I obviously didnt know this at the time, so I was just relaxing on the beach, wondering if there would be a ferry coming by or something so tourists could visit the little island, so I could grt on it like a tourist and go back to the main island. Well, I did get my ferry to the island, but in the form of a Nassau Police Department boat. Spent a couple of days in a Nassau jail, cousin ended up flying out to bail me out (thanks, Jerry).

FINALLY MY TIME TO SHINE. There are some layers to this so hold on.

I did this some years ago. The cruise we were on was from Miami to Mexico. Hiding myself wasn’t the hardest part, it was hiding my luggage. What I did was the night before, I touched NOTHING in my room, I did this because when house keeping comes in and the room hasn’t been touched I thought they would just do a once over and leave. We had a balcony so I put my luggage behind the chair outside so it was semi-hard to see. Step one was complete.

A couple days before I had met one of the crew members who was super chill. Like tell you where to buy weed when we docked chill. I get to talking to him and bought one of his uniforms for $80. Step two was complete.

I knew people who were getting on the ship next, this is crucial because if you don’t then where are you going to crash? My buddy and his girlfriend were cruising the next week, same route out of Miami. Without this I wouldn’t have even thought about staying aboard.

When we docked back in Miami and the call came for everyone to get ready to get off I made my way to the staff restroom with the uniform on over my regular clothes. I sat on the toilet for 7 hours while they turned the ship for the next guests. As soon as they started letting people on I dashed back to the room where my luggage was and awkwardly paced the halls, when the couple came who now had that room I let them know that a previous guest had claimed that they left their luggage and I needed to check for it. They let me in and my luggage was still on the balcony! I grabbed it and met up with my buddy. I still have the uniform in my storage unit as a very prized possession.","Redditors who have tried to hide on your cruise when it ended so that you could stay on the ship for the next round, how did that go?",0

The first thing to know is everything on the cruise is handled with your room key. The biggest challenge isn't remaining on the ship, it's more likely things like getting a working key card and not setting off alarms when you don't check out getting off the ship.

Your best bet probably involves sneaking onto the boat in the first place, likely posing as a clueless one-time contracted repair person for something innocuous on the ship, such as a lighting fixture, gas hose, or plumbing.

Since they'll probably check you in as a contractor, you'll want to have done that with fake credentials and a minor disguise. Everyone checks out of the boat in waves, so when about 20% or less of the people are left you could probably sneak back to a stage or event area, as these are particularly dead on transition days. Hiding in stage equipment is a safe bet, as there aren't a ton of major activities until after the first dinner.

As soon as other passengers load onto the boat, your best bet is faking being intoxicated and bouncing between bathrooms so no one forces you to do a room check-in or safety drill. You have to do them, but if they done have you as a passenger you don't want then trying to find your name on a list.

After that first afternoon, landing a sugar mamma or daddy would be a high priority too, as that might get you an actual bed, room key, and method for getting food or drinks.

Social engineering would be a super effective tool here. Unfortunately, my impression is that the people working on the boat are busting their ass for moderate pay. Many workers are from around the world, and are sending money home. The positions I believe are pretty competitive, so screwing up and pissing someone off could get you fired. Most employees, especially after the first day, won't go out of their way to interrupt you unless you're really being a problem. This is especially true if the problem could possibly have been someone else's fault before them.

If you're caught somewhere along the way the best option is probably saying you drunk overslept and thought they should take you for free, or that you mistakenly got on at some stop and they forgot to check you in. Getting on the wrong boat doesn't really happen, but again if you're a good lair and people manipulator, who knows?","Redditors who have tried to hide on your cruise when it ended so that you could stay on the ship for the next round, how did that go?",0

Very faintly I heard someone crying. I approached and found out that it came from a backyard. If I wanted to see who it was, I had to climb a high fence.

Nowhere else, just the garage. I somehow became friends with one, but she was unable to speak to me, leave the property that the house was on, and wasn't able to show any facial expressions that wouldn't be considered terrifying. Me and my ghost friend were playing on the house porch and two guys were trying to break into the house. She tried to stop them by scaring the living heck out of them by making a terrifying face and screaming the most blood curdling scream ever right in their faces. I wasn't able to see the face she made, but I somehow knew it was there, and all I could hear was the scream. The people trying to rob the house ran off, but instead of celebrating, I curled up and started crying because of how terrifying the scream was.

I absolutely loved that ghost, and I forgot that her whole purpose was to scare people, but she did it to protect me and the house. I still cried though, and she tried to cheer me up the best way she could. Then I woke up. I knew that was a dream, but I didn't want to leave my ghost friend alone knowing the last time she saw me was when she scared me to tears by accident. I tried to go back to sleep, and I did, and I somehow successfully reentered the dream, only it was several years in the future. The garage still had a couple of ghosts in it, but not nearly as much, and the rest seemed to be oblivious to humans. I was going into the attic and found some pictures in there of me around the age I was friends with the ghost, and on a picture I saw a very faint image of her face standing next me. I went down the attic and woke up.

I didn't get to tell the ghost that I forgive her or anything, and I still feel some sort of emotional attachment to her. It was probably the best nightmare I've ever had, and one of the dreams I've wanted to go back to the most, just so I can tell her that there are no hard feelings.

Edit: Thanks for comments everyone. I was just procrastinating and scrolling through Reddit and saw this post and thought, ""oh ya, that happened to me once"". I was seriously not thinking much of it and wasn't expecting this many people to be interested in it. This has made my day how many people have interest in this. Thanks.

Another edit for good reasons: For y'all out there, this is about my dream where ghosts exist and one of them I became friends with. I appreciate the support in the comments, but please stop wishing/hoping that we meet in real life. A ghost is a ghost. I would feel physically ill if I saw a ghost, wholesome or not. Thank you for your time.

One last edit because of skepticism: It's been like,  5 months since I left this comment here, and looking back on it, I probably should have cleared something up. I remember this dream pretty well because I wrote what I remembered from it on a piece of paper that I had brought to my room before I went to sleep so I could draw. I used to read it every now and then and I had memorized most of it eventually, and had written a very short story based off of it. I have since lost both of these pieces of paper and they've probably been thrown out by accident by now. Either way, I hope that clears something up regarding my memory of this dream, and yes, I know that my edits are starting to become the length of my story, you don't need to tell me.","Have you ever woke up in the middle of a dream and the dream was so interesting that you wanted to go back to sleep to see the end of it?

We just kinda stood there looking at each other.  It felt like a long time.  Ewoks just kinda start milling around and doing their every day shit.  Made some small talk with the Princess.  And then eventually the dream ended and I woke up.  It was a strange one.

edit: two words.  This was like the 4th strangest dream I've ever had.","Have you ever woke up in the middle of a dream and the dream was so interesting that you wanted to go back to sleep to see the end of it? If so, what was the dream?",0

So, I was walking down the street and met my primary school teacher, a cute old lady with the driest humour ever, we talked for a bit and she invited me over to talk and drink some tea.

I enter her house, she makes the tea and we sit in this area with 3 walls made out of bookcases, in between there were these 2 somewhat fancy chairs and a round low coffee table. We talked for a bit and she starts telling me how she brought me here for a good reason, and she just, does some magic or presses a damn button or whatever and a wall opens exactly like in Dexter's Laboratory.

She invites me in, and I see all these people, doing a variety of stuff, people being tied to metal hospital tables, in tubes, whatever. Everything had this technology kind of blue and I walked through this huge mall like revolving door. I realized I fell asleep a bit after walking, so it must've had some kind of sedative or something.

Anyway, I wake up, and in my fear I am tied to a metal table, without any skin, I can see my muscles, all of them, move, twitch and contract all while I am fighting to break loose from the table. That teacher comes by and says to me in the lines of ""don't worry, it's all part of the procedure"". I see other people around me, exactly in the same state.

She releases me after a bit, she gives me this spandex dark blue suit and told me to wear it. After I put it on I could move like, somewhat of a superhero, I could run really fast, I could jump really high, I was very agile and nimble. She told me I am some sort of recruit and that she has a mission for me.

After that I just remember teleporting to someplace by my home, with a gal that I knew by me as my ""duo"", with the task to catch this, black-invisible morphing dog? I remember aiming at that thing with something, like this bulky black blaster, after which, I woke up.

You can tell that my young me was VERY pissed for not being able to be a superhero.","Have you ever woke up in the middle of a dream and the dream was so interesting that you wanted to go back to sleep to see the end of it? If so, what was the dream?",0

So there were two islands that were shaped almost like crescent moons. The inner parts of the moons faced each other creating a circle of ocean between them. 

There were two big nations on each with smaller settlements trying to win their affection and trust. The smaller settlements were trying to get in the good favor of the big cities for protection. 

In the center of the islands was a large sea monster that occasionally attacked the people so they had huge walls with monster heads on them to try and deter it. 

Each city had its own politics, societal views, traditions, etc... The coolest thing in my opinion was that even though the cities competed against each other, they still worked together to have a stable economy and made sure each other had the materials to withstand the attack’s. 

I wanted to know more when I woke up. I wrote down everything I could remember and around a year later I’m still adding to the setting.

If that doesn't make much sense, I understand, so here's the story:

A few years back, I was going through a rough time, so to try and relax I decided to just take an afternoon nap. My dream started off in white void where some lady at a reception desk told me I was dreaming, and because I was stressed out and a lot of my work bore no fruit, and I was just border line depressed. The lady at the desk, said that she works for a dream company or something that operates between reality and dreams, and that they usually extend their services towards people who find themselves incredibly stressed, and allow them to have full control over their dreams so that at least in their dreams they can relax. However, they only provide their services a single time for one person. She continued to tell me that I would be allowed full control over my dream and proceeded to give me a lesson on the time difference between reality and dream time. She then gave me a contract that basically said that I would in this dream for 3 dream years, if I somehow managed to die, I'd wake up, if I decided I wanted to wake up, everything I do in the dream would be undone and would wake up, a whole bunch of stuff like that. After that she told me that she had to make sure that I didn't do anything TOO extreme that could harm my mind, so she would act as my supervisor.

When I was given full control of my dream, I was basically able to do God level tasks, created my own universe and personally developed galaxies and solar systems. Just so I wouldn't waste time, tall of those tasks were done in like a planetary scale of Sim City. I spent the first ""year"" of the dream crafting my ideal reality and making countless celestial bodies, at a certain point I even designed and brought to life various species' and personally created certain humans. I got to be the God of my own universe.

During the second ""year"", I watched most of my creations bloom and evolve all on their own. But there was one solar system I grew incredibly fond of. To fully immerse myself in that experience, I decided to give myself a human form and explore the planets I had created, but instead of the eyes of a god, I saw it in the perspective of a human. But I didn't want to waste my 3 years , so since  I was in full control of everything, I manipulated time so that I could experience a life time in the span of a few seconds of the 3 years I was given, but this was only in effect when I was in human form. My supervisor was always near my side so that I wouldn't be alone and end up doing anything extreme, but she allowed me to do this, as I wasn't breaking the rules of the contract, just bending it. I witnessed the evolution of my planet's life, and the development of its civilization. I wandered the planet which I populated with ruins, fictional like creatures, wondrous environments, and even explored the cities my creations built. I interacted with the people I created, various races, like demi-humans, intelligent monsters, etc. A total anime kinda thing. I traveled from planet to planet and experienced a science fictional life or traversing the stars, and discovering new species. My supervisor was like a traveling buddy and the we ended up becoming good friends. So in my second year, I lived for thousands of years exploring my universe, along side a friend.

Unfortunately, at the near end of the second year, a galactic war broke out, and people caught on to who I was and tried to hunt me down as they saw me as a failed creator. My own creations sought my destruction, and I didn't have the heart to destroy everything that I created, I loved the reality I made, and erasing it would've broken my heart. However, that wasn't enough to stop them from trying to kill me. If I were killed, I'd immediately wake up, so I decided to just get away while I could. But to my dismay, my supervisor got caught in the crossfire, and was fatally injured. Even though I had full control, I was unable to heal her as she told me that since she was not part of the dream I was in control of, my power has no effect on her. So I did the only thing I could think of at the moment. I ended my dream 1 year early. Since as I stated earlier, if I were to do that, everything that happened in the dream, it's existence, and it's effects would be undone; if I were to end my dream now, she wouldn't die. I watched my creation, my ideal universe disappear before my eyes. Even though I didn't have the heart to do it before, I had to convince myself that they were all just figments of my imagination, and that they weren't real. Just seconds before its complete disappearance, I bid farewell to my world.

After everything was gone, I found myself back in the white void with the girl waiting for me. Thanking me that I gave up the 1 year of near omnipotence I had to save her life. Even though she was grateful, she was upset that that meant the contract was broken, and ""they"" failed to fully accomplish their goal and fully relieve me of my stress. She blamed herself that such an experience was cut short because of her injury. I told her that it was alright, and that ""All dreams end anyway and that I probably would've spent my last year screwing around anyway"". She then proceeded to explain to me that I was beginning to wake up, and that I may not find my way back to this room ever again. Even though we spent so much time together, became close friends, and shared many experiences together, we both held back on a tearful goodbye. She got up, bowed, and said, ""Thanks for coming, I wish you good fortune when you wake up, and I hope to see you again."" After that, everything went white.

I immediately woke up afterwards, and didn't feel stressed or tired at all. I have full memories of the dream, and decided to get to work with an optimistic attitude. Though I still have my ups and downs, I've noticed, that ever since that dream, I've been having fun and just enjoy my life. But that was the greatest dream I have ever had.","Have you ever woke up in the middle of a dream and the dream was so interesting that you wanted to go back to sleep to see the end of it?

Walking in wooded area. See man standing stock still. Something’s clearly wrong. As I get near I see him start to move. I notice his arm is blackened and missing the hand. I say “Sir, are you alright?” He ignores me and starts walking jerkily forward, waving his arms like he’s feeling his way around. I call to him some more, but he never answers. I realize he has been in a fire or explosion and can’t see or hear, and is desperately trying to find help. I look around and see the husk of a house that either burned down or possibly exploded. I’m afraid to touch the man because it might cause him great pain. I start calling out for help myself when a van drives up. I’m relieved but then three men get out and start mocking me and the injured man. They tell me they are time travelers and start joking that I’m going to burn in that house along with the other man (presumably they’re going to take me back in time so that I burn, too?). I walk quickly away to try and get away from those guys. I feel bad for the other guy, but I’m not sure there’s anything I can do now.

Some unknown time later me and my wife are walking together. I’m still anxious over what happened before. We start walking through a kind of tunnel, though it’s more like a canopy of trees. Through the end of the tunnel we can see a house burning, but it’s like it’s in reverse, and eventually the house is totally fine. Now I’m incredibly anxious because I know that’s the house the time travelers said I would burn in, and I can’t stop myself from walking toward it.

Suddenly there’s an astronaut(?) at the end of the tunnel and he’s running toward us. My feelings about him are complex. It’s possible he’s trying to help us in some way, but there’s a feeling of inevitability, like he can’t help, or that he’s going to somehow cause a terrible thing to happen. As I watch him approaching it gets darker and darker until I can’t see anything. But I can hear the crunch of our footsteps as we walk and the heavy breathing of the astronaut as he runs toward us. I feel something touch me, and before I can figure out if it’s the astronaut or my wife I wake up, terrified.","Have you ever woke up in the middle of a dream and the dream was so interesting that you wanted to go back to sleep to see the end of it?

The hallway from my room paths straight for about 20 feet and then turns 90 degrees to the right. The upstairs hallway continues for about the same.amountnof length and the stairs go downstairs at a hair pin turn to the right. Instead of having a wall be next to the top platform of the stairs, the landing continued. On that platform I saw my mom's older sister & her daughter playing with her kid. As I watch them play on the carpet of this landing, it seemed as if we were outside playing in the grass but on the carpet on the same time. As I approach them I notice that in the corner of my eye I notice something at the bottom of the stairs. 

I look back down the hairpin to follow the rail of the stairs that banks back to the left. At the bottom of the stairs, offset by a few feet, I see a wooden park bench. It was oak & old, with that greyed out color from age & weathering. Rustic and rusted it stood there. I turn to look at it straight on and on the bench I see my grandmother. .. sitting there enjoying some breeze & the grassy interior that was now my house. I turn back to my cousin, her kid, and my aunt and say, ""do you see her?"" And point turning back to my grandmother. I see here straight on and she's still doing the same thing, enjoying the breeze and air. They say, ""who? Who are you talking about?""

I turn back and say, ""it's Medzmama (grandmother in Armenian), it's Medzmama right there!"" And point to the bottom where she is. They say no one is there & are looking where I am pointing exactly. I turn back to look and she is there. I said forget them I'm going to go to her. I ran down the stairs and as I ran I truly felt myself becoming a kid again, like a small incompetent motor skill equiped kid, running down flooding with joy to see those who love me and I loved them.

I once had a dream where I was running through this empty wearhouse trying to get to the end to reach some sort of goal. I never understood what I was trying to reach or even what the goal was but all I knew was I had to reach the end. I ended up slipping and falling to my death down some stairs. When I woke up I was such in a panic that I wouldn't be able to reach my goal unless I fell back asleep right away. I did but this time I took the  elevator. Still ended up dying, but I fell back asleep right away. A few tries later I was trying to jump out of the elevator before it dropped and I ended up getting cut in half. However this time I feel back asleep I was in the hallway I was trying to reach from the elevator. Unfortunately I was stopped by a person (I call this person my dream script supervisor) who wouldn't let me past and kept asking me strange questions on how I managed to survive everything that was killing me. I would just tell them I was fine and just to let me finish this so I can get to the goal. Then finally after a while of this back an forth I was asked about my legs and how could I be standing if the elevator cut them off. Again I was like nope I'm fine just let me pass. They put their hands on me and told me I had to look down before I could pass. So I did and I just see the floor no legs, but I angrily tell them I'm fine and I have my legs and I want to pass so I can reach my goal. I try to push past the person and when I go to take a step they just whisper 'where are your legs?' and prospective of my dream pulled out to show me just as a floating torso trying to push past this person and I instantly wake up. I tried for hours to try and put myself back into that dream so I could reach my goal but I wasn't.

It was all fun. Then when she used it the entire thing started to release a thick smoke that covered every surface as it flowed out. The smoke filled the entire room, and as it touched people they turned to stone. My brain even created the sounds of my dad and brother being turned to stone as I ran away. I was able to make it under the corner computer desk and watch the fog creep up around me. My mom falls to the ground reaching for me, and I watch her eyes as she turns to stone.

Told myself over and over, “they aren’t getting you this time” “aliens aren’t real” “you’re going to stop them”. When I finally fall asleep, everything happens the same, and as I’m sitting under the desk crying, I gained some lucidity “Aliens aren’t real”. The fingers start to wrap around the desk, and out jumps my older brother for a “gotcha!” Moment. I scream, we fight, and the day goes on. Never had the dream since. Also leveled up my sleep skill and can have lucid dreams now.","Have you ever woke up in the middle of a dream and the dream was so interesting that you wanted to go back to sleep to see the end of it?

They took the form of monsters similar to the ones in the movie the Nightmare Before Christmas, and there were also some resembling plague doctors. The creatures had magic, and the dream started with them in a football field, with very few people in the stands. It was a local football field, not a stadium. It was nighttime and everything had this weird gray dark glow to it.

Then, this human man starts causing a ruckus. Starts throwing things and yelling insults. A creature in the plague doctor outfit levitates over the stands to float right in front of the man. He is with his wife and kids. The plague doctor has a staff and points it at him. Suddenly, he disappears into thin air. The family claps, and we all know that the man is dead. The family is glad he is dead. The plague doctor disappears in a puff of air.

When you look around you can see creatures on the field chatting it up, with humans in the stands just waiting and chatting. half of the field is fenced off with a chainlink fence.

Suddenly, I leave this stadium as a boy around 13 years old. My friend (idk why but he was specifically black) is talking to me and we walk up to my house, which is right next to the field. You cannot see well into the field because the stands block it along with the chainlink fence around the field.

I say something like, “Okay, just hold on a second.”

My father is the creature that takes the form of a plague doctor, and so am I. We can do a wide variety of magic. My signature trick is to pull out more money than what I was given.

My father gave me $5, and it was crucial I gave it back.

I reach into my pocket, and there’s nothing. I pinch at nothing. There is no money in there. My father’s calling for me and he’s getting louder and louder. He is storming up into my room.

I start panicking, the room starts changing. It changes from an empty room with just a dresser, to dresser, bunk bed, closet, etc. My father bangs on the door. My friend keeps repeating, “Come on, show me the trick!” And I keep grabbing at nothing in my pocket, wondering what my father will do to me.

My father bursts through the door. In my peripheral vision I see that there is a red demon by his side. I glance at my friend and he looks scared and surprised, but at ME.

They are aware of their own feelings and are better at separating their feelings from fact (i.e., they're more likely to say ""I'm feeling X,Y,Z, negative emotion right now"" than ""Ugh, this teacher just hates me, what a bitch""). They're also better at seeing and accommodating emotions in other people. There's more awareness of and sympathy for mental health issues.

Here's an illustration: The other day, some of the students I coach were conversing and one young man asked how frequently they had a good cry. They all answered. And he said, ""I think I'm overdue for a good cry,"" and his peers started suggesting good movies to induce tears.

It was an utterly shocking scene for me! Great, but nothing I would ever have expected.

Kids can be stunningly introspective and empathetic when you ask them to talk about their interpersonal issues. There's a real effort to perspective-taking that goes beyond what I encountered at that age.

Also, the students I work with have some selection bias, to be fair, but the ones I encounter as a whole care a lot about current events. It's like it's actually cool to know and care what's going on, and it's uncool not to. This is very different from how I grew up. I think a lot of them would agree with the statement ""Being smart is cool and learning new things is fun"" which seems simplistic, but isn't true to everyone. I think it's related to the pressure to get into college. This pressure to be more well-rounded in your interests is a double-edged sword: kids get social capital from being exposed to different ideas and cultivating interests, but it's also a difficult race to model yourself into some ideal.

Edit: I should clarify that I am a coach, not a teacher, so my sample size is more homogeneous. I am also in a unique position where I regularly interact with urban public school kids (mostly low-income students of color) largely white, wealthy suburban public school kids, and first-year college students.

Like okay you woke af little baby take your healthy outlook on romantic courtship somewhere else. This is a self esteem free zone.

&nbsp;

**Edit:** Thanks for my first highly upvoted comment on AskReddit! I hate it! Let me address the main things people keep destroying my inbox with:

&nbsp;

Yes, it is good to be at a healthy weight. However, if you're only working out because you think someone won't be into you otherwise, you're doing it for the wrong reasons. If someone doesn't like you at slightly above your ideal weight, they don't actually like you. They either aren't that into your personality or they're shallow. Not worth your time or tears.

&nbsp;

Yes, physical attractiveness is important in romantic courtship. However, it's hardly the most important thing. People can find you more attractive after getting to know you. If you have a shit personality, it doesn't matter if you have perfect abs.

&nbsp;

What I wrote above is paraphrased. It's not a one to one. The point of the conversation is: barring being at an extremely unhealthy weight (see morbid obesity and anorexia) or some serious malformality, personality is more important than looks. And if someone doesn't like your looks at one weight (barring the above) they're not going to be more interested at a healthier weight. If they are, they aren't worth it other than for a quick shag. If you want to get to a healthy weight through diet and exercise, do it for you. Don't do it to impress others. Your motivation should be self improvement, not landing a shallow boyfriend/girlfriend.","Teachers of Reddit, what are some positive trends you have noticed in today's youth?",0

My son is 6 and on the autism spectrum.  He's somewhat verbal but still socially delayed and doesn't easily interact with peers.  He's not aggressive, but he's perfectly content to play on his own.  

He started kindergarten this year and while he's receiving special education, they try to have him in the class with the neurotypical children for a portion of every day (what they describe as integrative special education).  What blows my mind is how these children interact with him.  I drop him off occasionally and when I do, the other kids all will say hi and ask him how he's doing, even when they know he probably won't respond to them.  They invite him to play in the classroom and on the playground, and they are just genuinely nice kids.  When I was a kid, special education students were completely segregated from the mainstream students and we weren't taught about what made them different or how to interact with them.

Coca-Cola inventor John Pemberton is said to have written this recipe in his diary shortly before his death in 1888.[27][28] The recipe does not specify when or how the ingredients are mixed, nor the flavoring oil quantity units of measure (though it implies that the ""Merchandise 7X"" was mixed first). This was common in recipes at the time, as it was assumed that preparers knew the method.

Ingredients:
1 oz (28 g) caffeine citrate
3 oz (85 g) citric acid
1 US fl oz (30 ml) vanilla extract
1 US qt (946 ml) lime juice
2.5 oz (71 g) ""flavoring"", i.e., ""Merchandise 7X""
30 lb (14 kg) sugar
4 US fl oz (118.3 ml) fluid extract of coca leaves (flavor essence of the coca leaf).
2.5 US gal (9.5 l; 2.1 imp gal) water
caramel sufficient to give color
""Mix caffeine acid and lime juice in 1 quart boiling water add vanilla and flavoring when cool.""
Flavoring (Merchandise 7X):
1 qrt alcohol
80 oil orange
40 oil cinnamon
120 oil lemon
20 oil coriander
40 oil nutmeg
40 oil neroli
""Let stand 24 hours.""
Merory recipe	Edit
Recipe is from Food Flavorings: Composition, Manufacture and Use. Makes one 1 US gallon (3.8 l; 0.83 imp gal) of syrup. Yield (used to flavor carbonated water at 1 US fl oz (30 ml) per bottle): 128 bottles, 6.5 US fl oz (190 ml).[29]

Mix 5 lb (2.3 kg) of sugar with just enough water to dissolve the sugar fully. (High-fructose corn syrup may be substituted for half the sugar.)
Add 1 1⁄4 oz (35 g) of caramel, 1⁄10 oz (3 g) caffeine, and 2⁄5 oz (11 g) phosphoric acid.
Extract the cocaine from 5⁄8 drachm (1.1 g) of coca leaf (Truxillo growth of coca preferred) with toluol; discard the cocaine extract.
Soak the coca leaves and kola nuts (both finely powdered); 1⁄5 drachm (0.35 g) in 3⁄4 oz (21 g) of 20% alcohol.
California white wine fortified to 20% strength was used as the soaking solution circa 1909, but Coca-Cola may have switched to a simple water/alcohol mixture.
After soaking, discard the coca and kola and add the liquid to the syrup.
Add 1 oz (28 g) lime juice (a former ingredient, evidently, that Coca-Cola now denies) or a substitute such as a water solution of citric acid and sodium citrate at lime-juice strength.
Mix together
1⁄4 drachm (0.44 g) orange oil,
1⁄10 drachm (0.18 g) cassia (Chinese cinnamon) oil,
1⁄2 drachm (0.89 g) lemon oil, traces of
2⁄5 drachm (0.71 g) nutmeg oil, and, if desired, traces of
coriander,
neroli, and
lavender oils.
Add 1⁄10 oz (2.8 g) water to the oil mixture and let stand for twenty-four hours at about 60 °F (16 °C). A cloudy layer will separate.
Take off the clear part of the liquid only and add to the syrup.
Add 7⁄10 oz (20 g) glycerine (from vegetable source, not hog fat, so the drink can be sold to Jews and Muslims who observe their respective religion's dietary restrictions) and 3⁄10 drachm (0.53 g) of vanilla extract.
Add water (treated with chlorine) to make a gallon of syrup.
Beal recipe	Edit
In 2011, Ira Glass announced on his Public Radio International show, This American Life, that TAL staffers had found a recipe in ""Everett Beal's Recipe Book"", reproduced in the February 28, 1979, issue of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, that they believed was either Pemberton's original formula for Coca-Cola, or a version that he made either before or after the product was first sold in 1886. The formula is very similar to the one found in Pemberton's diary.[30][31][32] Coca-Cola archivist Phil Mooney acknowledged that the recipe ""could ... be a precursor"" to the formula used in the original 1886 product, but emphasized that the original formula is not the same as the one used in the current product.[33]

Fluid extract of Coca: 3 drams USP
Citric acid: 3 oz
Caffeine: 1 oz
Sugar: 30 lbs
Water: 2.5 gal
Lime juice: 2 pints (1 quart)
Vanilla: 1 oz
Caramel: 1.5 oz or more for color
The secret 7X flavor (use 2 oz of flavor to 5 gals syrup):

Alcohol: 8 oz
Orange oil: 20 drops
Cinnamon oil: 10 drops
Lemon oil: 30 drops
Coriander oil: 5 drops
Nutmeg oil: 10 drops
Neroli oil: 10 drops",What's the best kept secret on the Internet?,0

I had to do it a few years ago for a hospital I worked at. It's a basic little certification that shows you understand the signs of heart attack and also goes into why people are reluctant to get help. It doesn't give you a cpr certification or anything but the idea is if you catch it early enough you won't have to do compressions. Good info in it. 

Edit: Neat! I'm at work tonight and unable to respond to everyone but, as other people have said, if someone becomes unresponsive do compressions... Don't waste your time trying to figure out if they're having a heart attack! To the people who took the little course offered on the website I really hope you found it valuable!

Free, about six hours long. Hosted by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network and promoted by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. 

You learn how to help disaster survivors get referenced to the professionals they need and how to triage those with more damaging psychological distress before it gets worse. Learn the signs, symptoms, etc., and know where to forward the survivors to the proper agencies. Additionally there are some things on how to secure relief sites in consideration for physical and mental health.

There are also free courses on the website regarding helping children and military families with specific issues, but since I have not taken them yet I cannot comment on those classes.

EDIT: Yes, the class teaches you how to deal with both children and adults. Due to the nature of the training, psychological first aid can be comfortably taught online because there are no physical demands. I completed this in a day to enhance my resume for a masters program in psychology a while back. It looks very sharp on a resume. I hope this helps!

EDIT: The course is tailored to the U.S., but the ideas should be easily applicable anywhere. Anyone may register for a class online and take it at their own pace. If there are any issues, please let me know so I may update this post.

EDIT: Psychological First Aid is more designed towards a large-scale response. For individual psychological training, consider the [QTR Institute](https://www.qprinstitute.com/professional-training) which trains you in suicide prevention techniques in multiple different settings and environments.

It is ESPECIALLY good for any service industry, public sector, or communications job.

Edit-one thing to keep in mind is that just knowing ASL doesn't mean that you know the culture. Deaf/HH community is very deep and diverse.

**Edit:**

I didn't expect that this thread will get this much attention. So, I'd like to elaborate this topic a bit. First of all, my apologies for giving the wrong URL. I have now updated the correct URL. Register with your Gmail ID. For those wondering, NPTEL (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning) is a joint initiative of the IITs and IISc. Through this initiative, they offer online courses and certification in various topics. I am not sure they offer courses for International users. Course is free, but you need to pay for the exam and certification. At the time of enrolling a course in NPTEL I paid Rs.1000 INR. I got a certificate (hard copy). The certificate is pretty neat, decent, well framed. I enrolled a course titled ""Information security"". It was 6 level course. I completed only one level. They provide assignments during the course. You need to complete the assignments in order to be eligible for the exam. You can view list of online certification courses from NPTEL to be offered between July-November 2017 in this link: http://nptel.ac.in/LocalChapter/Assets/spoc_refdocs/Tentative_course_list_July_2017.pdf

You can take the courses for free but getting the certificate requires an upgrade (around £59 for most that I have seen so far).

If marketing is what you would like to do for a living, taking the Google test should be one of the first things you do. It used to cost $50 but now it’s completely off charge. Once you have their certificate, your value on the market drastically increases. After all, which business wouldn’t like to hire a person with thorough knowledge concerning internet ads and marketing? It is supposed to take about a week of studying to pass it. You will find plenty of information on this topic on the web, we can recommend [this page](https://www.launchdigitalmarketing.com/how-to-pass-google-analytics-certification/).

**2. FEMA Certification** 

Show your potential boss that you can handle conflicts, and that you possess the basic (or even slightly higher) knowledge of the command structure. It may be a bit tedious but it’s definitely worth your effort!

Unfortunately, this one is available only to American citizens. But don’t worry if you do not live in the United States, there still may be a chance for you to get the FEMA certification. Try the link [here](https://training.fema.gov/hiedu/collegelist/othercountries/) for the other countries.

**3. The Psychological First Aid Online.**

Which, once you sign up there, gives you an opportunity to participate in a test hosted by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network and promoted by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. It takes about six hours but it is not dull at all.

You learn how to deal with extreme situations – if (knock on wood) a disaster occurs, you will have means to react immediately, and perhaps, save many human lives. You are learning the symptoms and signs of severe psychological distress and you know how to help survivors and forward them to those institutions that will be able to provide help.

You learn how to aid both adults and children, you will also know how to secure relief sites, and if you are still hungry for knowledge, there are courses that will tell you how to help people with specific issues, including military families. This looks great on your resume, no matter the job.

**4. Point number three**

Not many know this, but YouTube offers a fully-fledged certification in both development and audience growth. You can quite easily learn how to be a skilled channel manager. In some jobs, the recruiters will go as far as to require this certificate. And even if they won’t, it’s just pretty badass to say to you are certified by YouTube 😀

It takes some time and may be pretty mundane, concerning mostly of slideshows and series of videos that end up with a multiple choice test after each section. You will gain knowledge that involves uploading schedules, thumbnails, tags, banners, and most of the things that create a complete YouTube channel and video.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkerton\_E.\_coli\_outbreak#Outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkerton_E._coli_outbreak#Outbreak)

We drank contaminated water for almost a week before they told us the truth. 7 people died, including one of my family members. We were all sick, and no one knew what was happening. The water treatment plant tried to cover it up by pumping chlorine into the wells (to hide the contaminated test results). The hospital was flooded with people and (because they were told it *couldn't* be e-coli) they were treating the wrong illness and actually made it worse. In some cases the hospital staff were told specifically that the water *wasn't* the problem, and so they advised us to drink water to help with the sickness.

I wish someone would tell our story.

I’m actually pretty shocked no one else has suggested this.  
The brutal massacre of over 400 unarmed civilians by US troops in the village of My Lai. 
Infants, women, children, and the elderly were slaughtered. 
Many young women were raped before being murdered. 
The massacre took place over the course of a day with the troops stopping to take a lunch break around noon. 
The killing was stopped when an American helicopter crew, having seen the events taking place, landed in front of a group of villagers about to be murdered. The pilot, WO1 Hugh Thompson jr ordered his crew to fire on the American soldiers if they tried to kill those civilians. He was responsible for the rescue of 14 people. When he reported the incident to his superiors an investigation was launched that triggered the end of the killing. For his actions WO1 Thompson and his crew were eventually awarded the soldiers medal, the highest Army award for bravery not involving direct enemy conflict. 
It was covered up for 20 months before a newspaper broke the story. 
A cover up all the way up to the division level took place. 
25 soldiers, including 14 officers, were charged with participating in the massacre or being complicit in its cover up. All but one had their charges dropped or were found innocent. The only person convicted was 2LT William Calley. He was found guilty of the premeditated murder of no fewer than 20 people. He was sentenced to life in prison. President Nixon ordered Calley to be released from prison and placed under house arrest while his appeal was ongoing. His sentence was reduced to 20 years. He would only serve 3 and a half years under house arrest before he was paroled by the secretary of the army in September 1974. 
Many soldiers wrote letters trying to draw attention to ongoing atrocities being carried out by American forces and that incidents like My Lai were the rule, not the exception. Those incidents, linked to the army’s demand for high body count numbers, were not investigated. 
It is estimated that the number of civilians killed and counted as military deaths is around 220,000. 

I know this submission is too late to get any real notice but I had to put it out there. 
For being such a grim subject it would make for some very compelling tv and would shed light on the incident. While it is recognized as a tragedy, the full scale of it is not really known or acknowledged.","If HBO's Chernobyl was a series with a new disaster every season, what event would you like to see covered?",0

An invisible deadly force that makes you taste metal and kills you in the worst way possible. The same force spread out and killed many more over the following years. 

The problem solving - that they could detect radiation in Belarus and knew based on its properties that it was coming from the Ukraine, likely Chernobyl.

The arrogance and coverups going as far down as Dyatlov and as high up as the government ministers. 

It's one big mystery - and it's terrifying. No amount of jump scares can make me more unsettled than this miniseries. 

***

With that said, I submit ""Love Canal"" for a hypothetical season:

- Guy wants to build canal to bypass falls, gives up. 
- Proximity to water and booming population in Western NY attracts industry, including Hooker Chemical. 
- They pollute. Legally and probably illegally.
- They trash the land. Know of all the horrible secrets there. 
- City of Niagara Falls wants to develop on land. Hooker Chemical is like ""uhhh no...seriously, it's bad""
- City insists, Hooker caves essentially saying that the city must acknowledge that they were warned
- City wants to build a school directly over the worst of the chemical dumps. Hooker intervenes. City goes ""okay, we'll move the school, but put the playground here""
- Construction crews accidentally crack the cover of the worst of the chemical landfills buried underground.
- Neighborhood becomes an American Prypyat. Families move in. Children swim in the unfinished canal. Picturesque. Classic. 
- Sickness begins. Not an incredible amount of suspicion, but there's some. 
- Very rainy spring in the 1970s.  Barrels of waste emerge in people's yards. There were more than just the one landfill. Waste was buried all over the place
- Eventually people take action, even kidnapping government officials. Superfund is created. 

***

The lies, hiding, carelessness, and politics alone make it a good story. Add in the scary dioxins and poisoning, and invisible sickness, add in the fact that there are other parts of the city with similar problems. Cap it all off with the remainder of the story - how almost all the neighborhoods were razed, driveways dug up, and a huge section fenced off. It's ""cleaned up"" but it's still a fucking wasteland. Even the grass won't grow the right color (Search ""Love Canal"" on google maps).

Follow up with ""There are x number of Superfund sites in the US today. It's estimated that there are another y sites that have not yet been discovered or blah blah blah.""

The true number of deaths is unknown. 80 is a very conservative estimate. This should never have been able to happen in one of the richest countries in the world, in one of the richest areas in the world.

Edit: just to add some more context into how at fault the councils are, the flammable cladding that caused the fire to spread so quickly all the way up and around the building cost £10million. 10 million on making the outside of a building look fancy so as not to offend the rich people living opposite.

I have now left this job after far too much bullshit, including me having to deal with constant panic attacks as well as severe depression and anxiety stemming from the constant terrible people I had to deal with every day. I have since moved on to a new job and as of me quitting on July 12th, 2019, nothing was done against this manager that I know of. I do still have friends working there (for the time being, seeing as many of us are quitting in droves) who will keep me up to date, but as of now I know nothing. Sorry to make it a lame ending with no outcome but I needed to get out of that place before I jumped off a cliff or put a bullet in my head.

**ORIGINAL POST**

My office manager has a huge giant massive HR case being built against her because she's been pulling royally shady shit.

Last year, some of us had been having issues with system access at my job, thankfully not me. It's a known issue and it's been getting fixed here and there, but then it rears it's head again. 

Anyway, about five or six months ago, a friend of mine in another department started losing access. My office manager (who is my boss' boss, she runs the whole friggin' meghilla.) tells this person to go home for the day since you don't have system access, and specifically told that it wouldn't be held against her.

So, what the hell, its not like she can do her job anyway right? She goes home. This happens about 8 more times where she comes to work and her systems don't work and she is told to go home.

Now, fast forward to about two weeks before the year ended. The girl whose been being sent home gets called over by her manager and told that she has to sign a final written warning. When asked why, she is told its because she has used all her FMLA AND sick leave. She said that is not possible and asks for proof before signing the document. Her manager pulls up all the times and days it was used and, lo and behold, it was every single time she was told to go home because of system access.

This is, of course, illegal as shit. My coworker did not choose to go home, she did not choose to use her FMLA and Sick leave. My office manager DID THAT FOR HER. 

So just about three weeks ago, my coworker gets called in to our office managers office and is told that she needs to give up her medical records. 

Also illegal as fuck.

She declined and told her she will not do that and is still not signing the final written warning. 

She then proceeded to call HR with all of this who then tells her, ""It's funny you should bring this to our attention because you're not the only one whose called us about things like this happening with her. We're building a case against her as we speak.""

Shits about to go down and im fuckin here for it. I hate my job, and I've actively been looking for a new one, but part of me wants to stick around to see if they tote her ass off to jail, or the mass shitshow that will happen when she's fired.

EDIT: woo boy this got blown out of proportion. I promise everyone if I’m around for the aftermath, i will update somehow lol. No clue how long this case has been being built by HR and no clue how long it will take to come to fruition but if I’m here for it, and it does, I’ll definitely do something to update everyone whose interested lol.

EDIT 2; ELECTRIC BOOGALOO-
Nothin' so far folks. I think this case might take longer to build than you or even I am thinking... Trust me when I say, I wanna see this come to fruition just as much as you guys do.

EDIT 3 (4/18/19); Still nothing guys. I'm starting to think nothings going to come of it... or if it is, it's not going to be any time soon. I will post a new thread in some subreddit somewhere when and if it happens, providing I still work there.",What's some juicy gossip you just found out in your personal lives?,0

Last year, my vice principal announced that he would be leaving at the end of the year. Let's call him Mr. Bob. I was shocked, as I liked and respected him a lot. It was well known that he was pretty unhappy, and it had been a tough year. I was confused though, because nobody else seemed shocked or upset. At the end of the year, I thought it would be nice to have everyone sign a card for him, but when I took it around people started giving me these weird looks. 

Fast forward to halfway through this year. One of our teachers showed up with a change of her last name. It was now Mrs. Bob. I congratulated her and said I didn't even know she was seeing anyone - to which she laughed and said ""you're so bad"". I was confused and shook it off.

Long story short, I just recently found out that she and Mr. Bob had fallen in love or something and he left his wife for her. He literally divorced his wife on a Thursday and was married by Friday. I had no idea until she mentioned his first name and that they were moving out of the state. 

Looking back on it, I face palmed so much. His wife at the time also worked for the district and at one point I ran into her and expressed how much I would miss working with Mr. Bob. She gave me a weird look and said, ""Yeah, well apparently he's been pretty miserable"". To which my dumb ass responded, ""Well let's hope he finds what he's looking for.""

His brother was living in his house rent free at the time as well. So his fianceé left him for his brother and had a fling with him for a couple months. The younger brother is basically homeless now, jumping from friend to friend to crash at their houses, while working at a job that he makes minimum wage at ($7.25), while she is still living under her ex-fiance's roof. 

She then decided she wanted to works thing out with her ex-fiance so they got back together and decided to reconcile the relationship which left the younger brother furious. Shortly after that, she finds out she is pregnant but does not know which brother is the father. Her fiance said he would raise the baby as his own even if it was not his. So she decides to keep the baby. 

This makes the younger brother more furious because she aborted the child before this baby that she knew was the younger brothers. So the younger brother verbally attacks her for aborting that child and keeping this one because there is a chance it is her fiance's.  She is unemployed during this time, so her fiance is paying for all of the expenses. 

*9 months later, still unemployed*

 She has the baby and it ends up being the younger brothers child and they all try to do co-parenting. The baby is 3 months old now and my family members fianceé left him for his younger brother again!

1. I am not comfortable giving out her porn name, but she is in the BBW category.
2. As far as him being a pimp, she was doing this before they met. He is still technically a pimp, doing deliveries and such, but this isn't some human trafficking thing, according to the information I have.
3. They found out by someone on my step dad's side of the family stumbling onto her porn online. My step brother is in a few of the videos.

Edit 2: The reason my mother was also pissed was because she got them a hotel room for the night before the wedding, and the location change for that date was noted on her calendar. Basically my mom was worried the police would think she was a pimp if my Step Brother and his GF got in trouble with the police, considering she paid for the room on her credit card.

I was the first person to be told about this. My mom now knows, but my aunts and uncles have no idea they have another half-sister running around somewhere.

Edit: my highest upvoted comment is now about my cheating biological grandfather. Cool. 

For those that have suggested trying to find her, my brother took a DNA ancestry test last year. I’ll ask him about the family tree part and what he found. 

Regarding telling the other family members, it’s certainly not my place. The problem is that biological grandpa (who will be BG from now on) was a piece of shit. He was abusive, drank himself to death, and abandoned my mom. The other relatives want to just move on. He isn’t talked about anymore. Grandma is trying to respect that, especially my uncle, who didn’t speak to her for a long while because he felt like she want just trying to turn the family against BG. If they accidentally find out through a DNA test, it truthfully would probably be less drama that way. 

Last note: the reason baby was easily identifiable aside from suspicious behavior was largely due to BG being a redhead. There weren’t too many in town, apparently.",What's some juicy gossip you just found out in your personal lives?,0

The next few years, she'd sneak out of college to meet him. Her family didn't like him because he was so much older and thought he was only in it for her money. Somehow they made it for nine years.

A year ago, he said in some social media post that he was single. Two months later, he announced his engagement with the young woman. 

Talking to friends with more familiarity of the situation, it turned out Jessica had to put up with a lot. Mary continued to be psycho and harassed her lot. This was because she was 34 and was planning on having kids with Joe before he cheated on her, and so she considers Jessica her life-ruiner. 

And Joe apparently cheated on Jessica as well, triggering mental health issues in her. After a psychotic episode, they broke up.

A friend of mine doesn’t have the best taste in men.  She’s been talking to this guy that I swear is a pathological liar. She refuses to believe it.  She just makes a lot of excuses for him while in the process of continually being disappointed and let down by him.  Over the last month, he was supposed to come visit her at least 10 different times.  He lives 3 hours away so it’s a long distance relationship.  Every time he was supposed to visit, something ‘came up’.  He was sick twice, then his daughter was sick, then he got ran over, then his moms dog is dying.  All of these are excuses on why he can’t come visit.  What’s fucked up is it will be his idea to visit.  He will constantly tell my friend he’s coming, she will tell him not to worry about it, but he will insist. All for him to give some bullshit, last minute, excuse on why he can’t show up.  It seems, to me, like a lot of work to lie like that, but whatever. 

This recent excuse was the most fucked up.  This actually happened last night.  The guy insisted on coming to see my friend over the weekend.  She got her hopes up just for him to call her last minute and say he got into a car wreck.  He told her he was at the hospital because he got hurt and his car was totaled, or some shit. My friend believed him at first and kept trying to ask him what hospital he was at but he wouldn’t tell her.  He even sent her a picture of the car.  So my friend messaged another friend of hers telling her what happened.  Long story short, the other friend asked my friend to send her the picture and she did some investigating and found an exact picture and article of a wreck that happened in a different state!  So the guy fucking lied about being in a wreck.  When my friend confronted him about it, he started laughing his ass off and told her it was this elaborate practical joke he was playing on her.  Well she believes him.  It’s all a big fucking joke and I don’t know who to be more pissed off at, the guy for being such a shady character or my friend who is so damn naive.

My fiancé works closely together with two colleagues: one is my best friend (let's call her Beth) and the other is his best friend (let's call him John). We like to hang out with Beth, John and both their significant others.

Beth is getting married to this really good guy, Jerry, this year. He is nice and sweet, although his jokes never really land, and to be fair: I find him kind of boring. Jerry and I never seem to be able to keep a conversation going for longer than five minutes. But no biggie, I'm not the one getting married to him.

This is where John comes in. You see, when Beth started at this workplace years ago, she was single and instantly smitten with John. She found him nice, funny and handsome. Only John was in a longterm relationship, so nothing came of that, except friendship. (John, Beth and my fiancé are something like the Three Musketeers at their workplace.) Along came Jerry in Beths personal life, and he and Beth started dating.

Meanwhile, Beth and John stayed very good friends and colleagues. Then, two years ago, Johns longterm girlfriend cheated on him. He ended the relationship. In the mean time, Beth and Jerry had started living together, but things weren't running so smoothly: Jerry is away for work A LOT, and due to a combination of circumstances, he was away for almost eight months.

In this time, Beth and John became even closer than they already were. They went out for beers with colleagues, but they would be the only two hanging around until the end of the night. She has this special tone in her voice when she talks to John. A lot of people started making little jokes about them being a couple.

One night, there was this work party. John put his new status as a single man to good use, flirting away with a lot of female colleagues. Beth, though, kept hanging around him. At one point my fiancé pulled her aside and asked her if she noticed that she was cockblocking John big time. 'Either you man up and just kiss him like you want to,' he told her, 'or you back off and leave him to it with Shelley from accounting.'

Beth backed off for a bit, but later that night, she had to go to the bus and John offered to walk her there. And when they were there, waiting for the bus - talking, laughing, goofing - they looked at each other and there was this... spark. They ALMOST kissed, but at the last moment Beth pulled away because, of course, she was toghether with Jerry and didn't want to do that to him. Plus, John is her friend and her colleague, so kissing him would probably just complicate things in stead of improving them.

So they both just kind of... acted like that never happened. Beth told only me and my fiancé about this weirdness between her and John.

Quite soon after this, John got into a new relationship. This girl, Natalie, is a sweetheart, only she is quite possibly the polar opposite of Beth.

Soon after John and Natalie started dating, Jerry proposed to Beth. And she said yes. We were all very surprised, not only because he asked her to marry him so soon after this rough patch they just went through, but also because they were together for only two years at this point, and Beth was only 25, which is quite young/soon in our country.

It seemed as if, as soon as John heard the news, he also wanted to do something drastic. After just four months of dating, Natalie moved in with him. She instantly started replacing all of his stuff with things that were more to her taste, up until the point where it feels like I've set foot into someones Pinterest board when I visit.

John and Natalie don't really seem happy. Beth and Jerry have been planning their wedding for the past two years, but Beth tells me that sometimes, she is doubtful of what could have been between her and John. Of course, soon after admitting that to me, she rushes to add that it would never work between them, because she is super motivated and he is still doing the same job he started in and even started working less hours because he makes enough money to live comfortably.

Natalie has been dropping hints about getting married, buying a house and having kids from the moment she moved in with John, and this september they're going on a big road trip. He is going to propose. We all know, even though he didn't outright tell us. If he chooses this path, this time next year he will have an expensie Pinterest wedding coming up, plus probably a mortgage and a baby.

Meanwhile, Beth and John keep doing fun stuff toghether - having drinks, working out. Natalie has started to give Beth some snark because of it. But when I talked to Natalie about our friend group, she only said super nice things about Beth, almost desperetaly so.

I know Beth has her doubts. I know John has his doubts. But it seems like they go through with their respective Big Life Altering Plans as some weird game of Chicken.

My fiancé and I just feel like there will be a moment in the future when the feelings they bottled up all come bursting out, and by that time there will probably be kids and other high stakes involved.

**TL;DR: my best friend and my fiancé's best friend obviously have feelings for each other, but they pretend that's not the case and are both planning on marrying other people than each other. Shit WILL hit the fan eventually.**",What's some juicy gossip you just found out in your personal lives?,0

This is completely untrue as he is fairly successful and has been for almost 20 years.  She said the house was frigid and the heat was only kept at 62° but he has a server in the house so that's not connected at all. /s  His partner is in school for his doctorate so my brother is paying for almost everything.  During this time his first dog was diagnosed with cancer and he was really disconnected and sad during her visit.

For SOME reason though, all of this and some other happenings made her think he can't possibly pay for this house and he's hiding it from her.  I had to listen to all of this and suppress the urge to tell her she's crazy.  I figured I would let it go because I have no idea what's truly going on.

My brother's dog passed away not too long after this so we were talking over the phone and her visit came up.  He goes on to say everything that she told me but in his perspective.  Not too different, but then he says that my mom took his partner aside to ask him if they were ok and if my brother was treating him right.  This wasn't the first time she's done this either.  She apparently ""warned"" my brother's partner when they started dating that he isn't exactly easy going and how high maintenance he was.

I was pretty shocked and appalled.  We've known for years that she is probably narcissistic possibly borderline but this really sealed the deal for me.  I couldn't finish a book describing the shitty things she's done but I'm pretty disgusted with her.  To top it all off she said that she thinks he has the narcissistic tendencies.

- stop giving in to your ex - if she asks for money early in the future just ask what she needs specifically and buy it for her, then take that off the subsequent payment - GOOD idea!.

Part of the money they get goes directly to buying the child food/clothes, etc, but supporting a child also means putting a roof over their head, utilities, gas to get them to and from, paying for school supplies, or a field trip, or replacing a lamp they broke, or paying for a family trip to the movies...

There are both direct and indirect expenses to having a kid, and hardly any non-custodial parent covers the entire cost via child support.

Therefore, the custodial parent rolls the child support into their general fund and then takes care of the child.

If the custodial parent has remarried and has more kids, they will pay for everything together, and so it would be impossible to separate out the one being paid support from everything else.

Child support is based on what the non custodial parent can afford and what they should be providing for their child if they had custody.  ",How would you feel about a law requiring parents that receive child support to supply the court with proof of how the child support money is being spent?,0

When we were together, his wife and I never argued about how we spent money on him. Neither one of us said the other couldn't buy something for him.

That's the primary reason why it's never happened before. 

But it goes further than that. Anyone who's gone through a contentious divorce knows that even with an attorney, all the record-gathering and -keeping can be a really big burden. Who reading this collects every last receipt for later accounting? How would you like, as a support payee, to have to split your child-related purchases from personal ones every time you shop? I mean, you'd see a lot of people splitting out child expenses to a separate account just to simplify the bookkeeping, but that wouldn't take care of all of the burden. 

And another consideration that I can tell you is unfortunately a real-world scenario much of the time: abuse. Abusers *very often* control their victims through the court system. Imagine someone like that being given free rein to kvetch about every line item spent by a support recipient. 

There are further policy reasons than these, but suffice it to say that because of these burden-based issues, I doubt we'll see any changes along these lines in our lifetimes.",How would you feel about a law requiring parents that receive child support to supply the court with proof of how the child support money is being spent?,0

Now just stop and think about how bad we are at agreeing on what's ""right"" and ""wrong"" on a moral scale. It'd be a nightmare.

For instance, few people would argue against buying one or two cups of coffee a month as fair. Also, most people would agree that spending $150 on dining out every day is excessive. But it would be insanely hard to argue where the line between the two exists and then, to complicate it further, we have to measure it against the best interests of the kids. Did spending $150 on dining out result in the children going without something they deserved? And how can we prove that? What's more:What if an expensive dinner is the only outing that parent has had all year... and it's a break that creates a stronger, more positive attitude so that the job of parenting is more effectively carried out?

Now imagine trying to argue all this in court... over 30... 40... 50... 100... 200 purchases a month. Every cup of coffee. Every drive-through hamburger. Every magazine. A cell phone bill. Cable TV. See how confusing that gets?

Child support is not supposed to be about ""Did you earn it? Do you deserve it? Are you using it the way I think you should?"" It's about each parent contributing something. This is why, even if one parent is a multi-millionaire, the other parent still has to contribute.

And that's not even taking into consideration the insane ""grudge"" abuses of that law: A bitter divorcee who wants to punish his (or her) ex ends up taking them to court over and over, racking up legal fees the ex can't pay, forcing them to justify every cent that leaves the bank account... every month... for years and years. Can you imagine the living hell that would be? And how many assholes would manipulate it for just that purpose?

If there's some sign of abuse or negligence (say, for instance, the child isn't getting medication) then that's actionable and will probably result in the court getting involved. Which it should. But if the kids are getting everything they need, are safe, able to play, able to study and do homework, are fed properly, able to sleep properly, and are properly clothed... it's very hard to establish that X number of dollars should have been spent over and above that. Trying to do so would be a tangled, fucked-up mess of arbitrary morality and unfair precedents that would do more harm than good. We have to accept that, once we know the kids are properly cared and provided for, we don't get to decide how the money gets spent.

She's eight now. Her kid is like my kid now. From her kids father we receive $40-50 a week. 


That amount is hardly enough to feed just one kid, most of the time. The average unskilled laborer would draw that amount in five hours.
 

To this day I have never known the man to buy her a toy outside of a holiday or birthday or any clothes. When she comes home from the weekends (the ones I choose to meet him halfway, mind you,) she's not changes her clothes or bathed. Mostly she just plays video games and watches Netflix /YouTube. 


To me, if I spend that $50 a week on Legos for the kid, it's my really none of his business. While not everyone is the same, and every situation is different (which is why this doesn't work) if you don't like it, *go get custody*.  Mostly for us it's babysitting money, we both work 50ish hours a week. And it doesn't cover the amount, and he doesn't take her a minute longer than he's entitled to by law outside of holidays and vacations.

So it's hard to find documents that make me a little sick to my stomach.

The absolute worst though are the ones in which US generals ran through nuclear war plans and their consequences. Here are a bunch of serious, patriotic, hard-working people, all of whom believe in the ideals of the country and all that, and they're having conversations about killing of hundreds of millions of people, nearly all of them civilians, because they believed that this was the only way to keep the same thing from happening to American civilians. 

Every once in awhile there is someone who says, in essence, ""what the fuck are we doing."" It's rare, but it happened. And that is both kind of refreshing and kind of terrible in its own light — like, if they _never_ asked that, it'd be creepy, but you'd be able to say, ""well, they really just never saw it as a problem."" But the fact that every once in awhile someone says something like, ""this sounds like the Wannsee conference"" (the meeting at which the Nazis hashed out the ""Final Solution"" of the Jews) makes it clear that these people, somewhere deep inside, know this isn't really the way that decent people ought to be acting.

Here's an account from a war planner at a meeting in 1960:

> The meeting took place near mid-December 196057 at Strategic Air Command (SAC) headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska, attended by Secretary Gates, Deputy Secretary Jim Douglas, myself, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a multitude of general officers representing every unified and specified Command from all over the world. [...]

> After presenting a few charts he came to one defining the first wave of attacks to reach the Soviet Union. As I recall, these came from carrier-based fighter-bombers stationed near Okinawa. Having made this disclosure, he stepped aside.

> Thereupon two airmen appeared, one from each side of the long wall lined with maps, each carrying a tall stepladder. Each airman stopped at the edge of the large map which, we now observed, showed China and the Soviet Union and probably some other nearby features on a heroic scale. Each man climbed his tall ladder at the same brisk rate, reaching the top at the same instant as his counterpart. Each reached up toward a red ribbon which, we now noticed, encircled a large roll of clear plastic. With a single motion, each untied the bowknot securing the ribbon at his end of the roll, whereupon the plastic sheet unrolled with a whoosh!, flapped a bit and then dangled limply in front of the map. ...

> Each time the briefer described an attack wave the ballet of the ladder masters would be re-enacted. They would untie another pair of red ribbons, a plastic roll would come whooshing down and Moscow would be even further obliterated beneath the little marks on those layers of plastic sheets. There were little marks in other places, too, but somebody noted that a third of Soviet industrial-military strength was concentrated in the greater Moscow area, hence the concentration of bombs dropped on that region. I recall that the plan called for a total of forty megatons—_megatons_—on Moscow, about four thousand times more than the bomb over Hiroshima and perhaps twenty to thirty times more than all the non-nuclear bombs dropped by the Allies in both theaters during more than four years of WWII …

> At the point in the briefing where some bombers were described flying northeast from the Mediterranean on their way to Moscow, General Power waved at the speaker, saying: “Just a minute. Just a minute.” He then turned in his front row chair to stare into the obscurity of uniforms and dusk stretching behind me and said, “I just hope none of you have any relatives in Albania, because they have a radar station there that is right on our flight path, and we take it out.” With that, to which the response was utter silence, Power turned to the speaker and with another wave of the hand, told him to “Go ahead.”

> A subsequent chart shown by the briefer displayed deaths on the vertical axis and time in hours, extending out to weeks, along the horizontal axis. He announced that there were about 175 million people in the USSR. This chart depicted the deaths from fallout alone—not from the direct effects of blast or radiation from a bomb going off, just from fallout subsequent to the attacks when radioactive dust propelled to high altitudes by the initial blast begins to fall back to earth. The curve of deaths, rising as time went by, leveled off at about 100 million, showing that more than half the population of the Soviet Union would be killed from radioactive fallout alone.…

> The briefing was soon concluded, to be followed by an identical one covering the attack on China given by a different speaker. Eventually, he too arrived at a chart showing deaths from fallout alone. “There are about 600 million Chinese in China,” he said. His chart went up to half that number, 300 million, on the vertical axis. It showed that deaths from fallout as time passed after the attack leveled out at that number, 300 million, half the population of China.

> A voice out of the gloom from somewhere behind me interrupted, saying, “May I ask a question?” General Power turned again in his front-row seat, stared into the darkness and said, “Yeah, what is it?” in a tone not likely to encourage the timid. “What if this isn’t China’s war?” the voice asked. “What if this is just a war with the Soviets? Can you change the plan?”

> “Well, yeah,” said General Power resignedly, “we can, but I hope nobody thinks of it, because it would really screw up the plan.” ...

> That exchange did it. Already oppressed by the briefings up to that point, I shrank within, horrified. I thought of the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, when an assemblage of German bureaucrats swiftly agreed on a program to exterminate every last Jew they could find anywhere in Europe, using methods of mass extermination more technologically efficient than the vans filled with exhaust gases, the mass shootings, or incineration in barns and synagogues used until then. I felt as if I were witnessing a comparable descent into the deep heart of darkness, a twilight underworld governed by disciplined, meticulous and “energetically mindless groupthink aimed at wiping out half the people living on nearly one third of the earth’s surface. Those feelings have not entirely abated, even though more than forty years have passed since that dark moment.

Excerpts from John H. Rubel, _Doomsday Delayed: USAF Strategic Weapons Doctrine and SIOP-62, 1959–1962_ (Lanham, MD: Hamilton Books, 2008), 23–39, as quoted in Daniel Ellsberg, _The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner_.

Other than that... this was never classified, but reading the official US guidance for how to dispose of millions of corpses in the event of a nuclear attack is pretty chilling:

> To plan and organize for the disposal of the bodies of millions of civilians killed in an enemy nuclear attack is a grim business, even for those trained and accustomed to the work of mortuaries. The individual care we traditionally bestow on our deceased will not be physically possible when the dead must be counted in the thousands. However, FCDA, with the assistance of its Religious Advisory Committee, is planning for suitable memorial services for the dead in areas devastated by enemy attack. ...

> Final legal identification by personal recognition will not be possible because of the large number of dead, wide dispersal of the population after a disaster, and lack of necessary space, time, and labor. Ten thousand unidentified bodies would require over 5.5 acres of space (250,000 square feet) for adequate display. A person would walk 5 miles between the rows of bodies before all were seen and for each 25,000 identifiable bodies probably 10,000 would be unrecognizable because of disfigurement by injury or fire.  ...

> Mortuary and burial areas selected should have space to accommodate about 25 percent more than the maximum expected number of bodies. … A method of rapid, mechanical grave digging and filling will be needed for the large number of graves required. … If conditions permit, mechanically dug continuous trenches offer the best solution to the burial problem. If the machines available are capable only of digging narrow trenches, bodies can be placed head to foot instead of side by side.

Initially, they wanted hundreds of dogs. They only actually got ten, and of those only a few were implanted. The ones which were would be ""remote controlled"" by zapping them and essentially giving them a dose of dopemine when they were facing the right direction. The controllers would stop the dope-zap when they wanted the dogs to stop, and then the dogs would re-orient themselves until they were facing the correct direction. This meant when the controllers weren't present, the dogs who had been implanted would continually spin in circles, even in their cages, always looking for the direction that gave them that next hit.

The program ran out of funding in the mid 60s, and the dogs were destroyed.

Robert Levinson, former FBI agent, retired and began working as a private investigator, specializing in Russian crime circles.  Levinson traveled to the Persian Gulf’s Kish Island, which had fewer restrictions on American passports due to being a free-trade zone, to enter Iran.  He was last seen March 9, 2007.  For three years after his disappearance, the US government was adamant that he was not acting with a government party, only private PI work.  

After 3 years, it was confirmed that Levinson was acting as part of the CIA on an unauthorized mission to gather data on an Iranian regime.  He has had a proof-of-life appearance in 2010. Levinson has seven kids, one of which with his mom that have traveled to Iran find their dad and husband, only to be shown plane manifestos by Iranian officials, suggesting that Levinson had left. 

As of 2013, if he’s still alive, Levinson is the longest-held American captive at 12 years.

While never fully developed, it was a hypothetical UK War Plan that would have started WWIII before WWII was even over. It called for Allied troops to attack the Soviet Red Army at Berlin and push them out of Europe entirely. Not having the manpower to fight them alone, the plan not only relied heavily on American forces, but also called for the re-armament of German soldiers who would then fight alongside the Allies.

The plan didn’t get much traction because public support by that point would be been close to 0, and the Americans weren’t interested since they still had Japan to deal with and a war against the Soviets would likely lead to a Soviet-Japanese alliance, among other obvious issues with the plan.

In 1975 the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (AKA the Church Committee) looked into activities by the CIA, NSA, and FBI. There was also a White House and House of Representatives committees to look into those agencies in 1975. The heart attack gun was revealed at committee hearings. First big issue of the committee was that those agencies had free reign to do what they want. The Church Committee's investigations led to the Senate Intelligence Committee to oversee the CIA which until then had not had any congressional oversight. The very existence of the National Security Agency wasn't revealed to the public until the Church Committee. Other revelations include NSA spying on the American public without warrants (Project Minaret and Project Shamrock. Even Committee Chairman Frank Church had been spied on.

The CIA drugged unknowing individuals with LSD as part of mind control experiments (Project MKULTRA) and destroyed documents related to the project.   
   
 In the 1990s the CIA provides flawed nuclear weapon plans to the Iranian government (Operation Merlin). The Iranians discovered and corrected the flaws so their nuclear program was actually accelerated by the CIA.

The short version is that a B-29 crashed, and there was an official report about the cause.  Families of people who died in the crash wanted the report, which may have included evidence of negligence that lead to the deaths.  Because the report was embarrassing, the US Government refused to hand it over, and claimed - falsely - that the report contained sensitive information about military secrets.  They asserted what is now known as the ""state secrets privilege"" to keep facts from the affected families and from the public at large.  Courts, up to the Supreme Court, accepted this argument and established the principle by precedent.

Decades later, the report was declassified, and there were no secrets it in.  The entire thing was just a lie all along, and the courts went along with it, and the practical result is that the government can just lie at any time about ""national security"" whenever they want to cover up evil or idiotic actions by government officials, and they always get away with it.

That's why, for example, people tortured by the CIA can't sue: because our torture program is a state secret.

>The Gulf of Tonkin incident (Vietnamese: Sự kiện Vịnh Bắc Bộ), also known as the USS Maddox incident, was an international confrontation that led to the United States engaging more directly in the Vietnam War. It involved one real and one falsely claimed confrontation between ships of North Vietnam and the United States in the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin. The original American report blamed North Vietnam for both incidents, but the Pentagon Papers, the memoirs of Robert McNamara, and NSA publications from 2005, proved material misrepresentation by the US government to justify a war against Vietnam.

>The outcome of these two incidents was the passage by Congress of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted US President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by ""communist aggression"". The resolution served as Johnson's legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam.

[Same goes for Gulf War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_testimony):

>The Nayirah testimony was a false testimony given before the Congressional Human Rights Caucus on October 10, 1990 by a 15-year-old girl who provided only her first name, Nayirah. The testimony was widely publicized, and was cited numerous times by United States senators and President George H. W. Bush in their rationale to back Kuwait in the Gulf War. In 1992, it was revealed that Nayirah's last name was al-Ṣabaḥ (Arabic: نيرة الصباح‎) and that she was the daughter of Saud Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States. Furthermore, it was revealed that her testimony was organized as part of the Citizens for a Free Kuwait public relations campaign, which was run by the American public relations firm Hill & Knowlton for the Kuwaiti government. Following this, al-Sabah's testimony has come to be regarded as a classic example of modern atrocity propaganda.

[Iraq War too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger_uranium_forgeries):

>The Niger uranium forgeries were forged documents initially released in 2001 by SISMI (Italian military intelligence), which seem to depict an attempt made by Saddam Hussein in Iraq to purchase yellowcake uranium powder from Niger during the Iraq disarmament crisis. On the basis of these documents and other indicators, the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom asserted that Iraq violated United Nations sanctions against Iraq by attempting to procure nuclear material for the purpose of creating weapons of mass destruction.

[Operation Northwoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods):

>Operation Northwoods was a proposed false flag operation against the Cuban government that originated within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) of the United States government in 1962. The proposals called for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or other U.S. government operatives to commit acts of terrorism against American civilians and military targets, blaming them on the Cuban government, and using it to justify a war against Cuba. The possibilities detailed in the document included the possible assassination of Cuban émigrés, sinking boats of Cuban refugees on the high seas, hijacking planes, blowing up a U.S. ship, and orchestrating violent terrorism in U.S. cities. The proposals were rejected by John F. Kennedy.

>The plan was drafted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, signed by Chairman Lyman Lemnitzer and sent to the Secretary of Defense. Although part of the U.S. government's anti-communist Cuban Project, Operation Northwoods was never officially accepted; it was authorized by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but then rejected by President John F. Kennedy. According to currently released documentation, none of the operations became active under the auspices of the Operation Northwoods proposals.

The  fact that the highest levels of the Department of Defense and JCS thought that committing terrorist acts against US citizens was an acceptable idea, and that none of these people were jailed for treason, really blows my mind, and makes me wonder what on earth is going through the heads of top brass today.",What are some declassified government documents that are surprisingly terrifying?,0

3) Advancements in carbon structures create wearable fabrics with the strength of steal. Firearms are no longer reliably lethal, and extreme sports become practically free of terrible injury.

4) Biologists unlock the secrets of hydras allowing the end to aging, people become massively wise and intelligent with their unending life spans, then venturing into the cosmos to learn about the universe.

5)Fusion energy along with powerful batteries and better agricultural practices make all corners of the globe well fed and without need for resources.

She lives there, but he doesn’t. He’s leaving for his home on the other side of the country the next morning. They wander the streets of the busy city all night long, chatting constantly about their hopes and dreams.  They watch the sunrise wrapped in each other’s arms.  When she takes him to the airport the next morning, she’s clearly upset. She’s never met anyone she gets along with so well. He offers to stay in touch with skype and they exchange usernames-but she isn’t too hopeful about the situation.  When she gets home from the airport and lets her computer wake from its sleep mode, she notices he’s added her before ever even getting on the plane, only moments after she left him according to the time stamp. 

Later that night when he’s settled at home he logs onto skype to see her icon is online. He messages her instantly. Their playful banter and easy conversation flow long into the morning hours. Over time their weekly skype sessions become daily. They begin to show each other their home cities-taking their phones with them to skype anywhere they can. He walks her down a street festival where music and light pour from every stall. His head phones in only he can hear what she has to say to him. She makes an hour long drive to her parents’ house, and he skypes with her on the drive, keeping her entertained with car games and random trivia. She sends him a recipe she found online, and that night they make and eat the same meal on opposite sides of the country. They begin to look forward to seeing each others skype icon alight every single night without fail. They even turn on a tracking app that helps them see how far the other has to go before they are home. They fall asleep while skyping and wake to each others sleeping form. 

But distance makes all things hard. Months pass. Both their data bills are through the roof. He begins to feel a lack of connection to her-the real her. She feels like all she knows of him is the face of her phone. As if the device and the person are one in the same. They miss one skype. Then another cause he has to work. Another cause she fell asleep while waiting for him. One day, though they pre-agreed to skype that night, he never even shows. The icon stays unlit and though she tries to keep her mind steady, she feels the cold hard stab of doubt in her chest. Was it something she said? Did? Is he with someone better for him? One that doesn’t pester him every day? She checks the tracking app. Nothing. His isn’t even turned on. Sending another stab of doubt through her. Where could he be that he doesn’t want her to know? Why is he hiding his movements? He never seemed like someone who’d do that. But did she ever really know him? Or just the online him? Another hour passes and though she tries to keep occupied, she can’t stop checking. Still nothing. In her frustration she throws down her phone and the screen shatters. The white light bleeding black from every crack into the screen. Angry, hot tears spring to her eyes as she watches the grey icon flicker away completely. 

Her doorbell rings and as she swipes away her frustrated tears she apologizes to the phone. Picking it up off the floor, she wipes away spare shards of screen glass, as if that will turn back the clock. She knows it can’t hear. It’s not a person nor the thing she’s angry about but, it did nothing wrong. With phone in hand she walks to the door where there he stands. A duffle under one arm, too big to be an over night bag. In the other he has his phone out. “Why aren’t you online?” He says “I was gunna surprise you. But my flight was late.” She launches her self at him, into his arms, causing his phone to fall to the ground. No more devices between them.

A scientist creates a VR setup that puts men into a full immersive VR experience where they are forced to live the lives of a person from their shoes. The person who in particular is in the test subjects is a White male neo nazi serial rapist who in VR is made to be a poor southern black woman who works as a maid during height of the fight for civil rights act. 

**Edit**

The neo nazi is shocked when he sees himself in the mirror. Woken up by little black children asking momma to get up. Its time to go to church. He keeps trying to hit them or destroy everything but like a child parental lock the full sensory VR experience rewinds. Like the perfect mixture of groundhog day for the first 1/5 of the episode the Neo Nazi now diminutive black woman with children learns who he is supposed to be. Where he works. every time he stand up for himself after someone belittles him the program starts over again from the very beginning. You see this small black womaning dropping all these racist epitaphs between reboots. But eventually half way through he finally gives in it going back to his internal self image when he closes his eyes in the vr full sensory world. He tried to kill himself once or twice but the program beboots again. Eventually the nazi just accepts his depressing soul breaking position in life, but at the same time becomes highly protective of his children in the program as they are the only source of love he gets. Learning that his husband in the program had been lynched. 

**End Edit**

The VR set up makes him expiance all the horrors he commited on others. This includes the experience of being kidnapped by a group of white men on the way home from work because the section for black people on bus was full even though the whites only section wasn't and wouldn't let her on. The gang of southern white men beat him up then then take turns gang raping him. The scene starts cutting between the persona avatar he is and the neo nazi white guy himself being raped by these men who are spitting and pouring liquor over him and her. When done the black woman avatar and the neo nazi fuzed in an amalgam of them the skin speckled with black and white skin and patches of tattoos with swastikas and hate symbols. The eyes of the black avatar once brown are now the piercing blue eyes of the Neo Nazi. His eyes now open as the white gang rapists kick him/her one more time and threaten to kill him if he tells anyone. He passes out. Waking up now in a hospital from a coma representatives from the NAACP are there and say she will get justice.  He then goes into tunnel vision and is expelled like a water slide in his minds eye back to the real world. He wakes up from the experience falling on his knees crying having had a crash course in empathy having lived the life as a poor southern black woman in segregated america and rape victim at the ""height"" of white on black violence in america. 

* In the **White Mirror** ending he goes on to start a group to stop hate

* In the **Black Mirror** ending the staff help him up and then put him back in the chair with him waking up again this time as a Japanese american woman in Los Angeles who is outside her family store to see someone had spray painted JAPS NOT WANTED on the window and a bus on the street corner with japanese americans lined up with armed service men forcing them on the bus for japanese internment during World War 2.","If they made a show called ""White Mirror"" that was about all the positive aspects of the human/technology relationship, what would be the plot of certain episodes?",0

Junko Furuta, who was a perfectly normal girl until she was kidnapped off the street by a gang for no reason (purely wrong place, wrong time, according to Japanese sources) and unimaginably raped and tortured to death over 44 days.

Kiki Camarena, a DEA agent in Mexico who was kidnapped by the Guadalajara Cartel and tortured to death over about three days. His story is the central focus of the show Narcos: Mexico, but from what I've read, his death was even more brutal than what they make it out to be. A detail consistent in both is that they brought in a doctor to revive him numerous times when he got too close to death, and keep him conscious so he couldn't pass out from the pain.

Kelly Anne Bates, who was groomed from a young age by a scumbag who eventually killed her slowly over the course of about a month in their apartment. Her injuries were so horrific the jury at the guy's trial had to get counseling. For example, her eyes were missing and there were stab wounds in the sockets.

Sylvia Likens, whose parents left her in the care of a woman who both personally and with the help of her children and their friends degraded, tortured, and killed over over several months.

The Hello Kitty murder in China, where a man and his about-13-year-old girlfriend kidnapped a prostitute who had supposedly stolen from him (even though sources say she had paid him back with interest), tortured her to death, and then stuffed her corpse into a Hello Kitty toy.

Baby Brianna, a newborn whose mother, father, and uncle tortured and raped her from the second they brought her home from the hospital until the second she died.

Baby P, a British toddler whose mother let her boyfriend torture him to death. His back was broken in his last days of life.

He told me about a mission where he and one other American with five CIDG strikers (South Vietnamese villagers turned fighters) were tasked to emplace seismic ground sensors along a trail network deep in the jungle.  He said they were about two days into the mission when he and two of the strikers split off from the main group to go watch a nearby trail intersection.  He said the jungle was pretty quite that day, just the sounds of birds and bugs and an occasional monkey.  He said they had been watching the trail intersection for about three or four hours and were deciding on whether to move further down the trail or to turn back and link up with the rest of the patrol.  Before leaving the cover of the brush my Dad said he checked the trail ahead of them one last time and prepared his men to move.  Now here is where the story gets interesting and he told this part with absolute dead seriousness.  He said just as he started to step out onto the trail he sees a light skinned Black Union Cavalry Soldier in full battle gear laying alongside the trail just shy of the intersection.  My Dad said the Union Soldier had two pistols, a Spencer rifle and a short curved club at his hip.  As my Dad was trying to process what he was seeing, the  Soldier looked directly at him and smiled.  Then the Soldier slowly placed a finger up to his lips as if to tell him to be silent and then motioned my Dad back off the trail.  My Dad said he signaled for his men to remain hidden and he recalled that as he slipped back into the jungle on one side of the trail, the Union Soldier did the same on his side of the trail.  Less than 10 seconds later he said the lead element of a group of NVA (North Vietnamese Army Soldiers) walked right through the trail intersection some 30 feet away.  My Dad estimated that the group was comprised of some 70 - 80 Soldiers equipped with automatic rifles, light machine guns and rocket propelled grenade launchers.  He has no doubt that his entire team would have been wiped out on the spot.  He said as soon as the enemy Soldiers had passed, he and his team beat feet out of there as fast and as quietly as they could and rejoined with the rest of the patrol.  He reported the enemy Soldiers his team had encountered, but decided not to say anything about the Soldier he had seen.  My Dad kept this secret for many many years; only telling me just before he passed and earlier only telling his Grandmother on her death bed in the 1970s.  He said when he told his Grandmother, she smiled and without opening her eyes told him, “you saw Old Red Tom”.  Red Tom was my Great Great Grandfather.

About 10 days later she was found by a homeless man who witnessed her crawling up to a bus stop in the city, begging for help.  She had broken a leg and an arm, and was in very bad shape.

At the (quite large party) she had her drink secretly drugged and was then led off by a group of men into their vehicle.  She was taken to an apartment where she was drugged, repeatedly raped, and locked in a small room in between with a bucket to use as a bathroom.   At one point after being injected with heroin and raped, she somehow managed to convince one of her captors to allow her to use the actual bathroom to clean herself up.  This bathroom had a small window to the outside, and with the shower running, she managed to squeeze out and fell from the third story into a large hedge/bush.

Many years ago, before there were cell phones we had these things called  pagers strapped to our hips. Someone would page you with their phone number and you would call them back when you got to a phone. As an ""on call technician"" working in the Audio Visual field, my pager would go off all the freaking time. Like most people who used pagers, our clients  knew that if you followed up your number with a 911, that would  indicate to the technician to stop what they were doing and call right away. Although I was always busy I rarely if ever got 911's. One  afternoon traveling from Orlando to Saint Petersburg via Interstate 4,  my pager goes off with a number I don't recognize, followed by the 911. I  find the first exit, and pull into a little truck stop looking place outside of Plant City, to use the pay phone. This takes maybe 3 minutes tops. I walk in, ask for some change and head to the wall where there  are 4 pay phones to choose from. I pop my quarter in and dial the number  displayed on my trusty pager. It rings........ and rings...... and  rings....... and rings. I'm thinking to myself WTF ?!?! Who would page  me with a 911 and not answer their phone? it's just about then that I  notice another ringing sound in addition to the one in my ear..... I  pull the handset from my ear and two phones over on the wall another pay phone is ringing, but with an incoming call. I hang up my the handset and the ringing stops on the other phone. I walk a few paces over, pick  up the handset and look at the phone number printed above the buttons , I  look at the number on my pager, I look at the number on the phone, I  look at the number on my pager again, I look at the phone AGAIN.....  except for the 911 they are identical. I kinda loose my breath for a  second and then I make my way over to the girl at the counter and ask if  she saw anyone use the pay phone. She said I was the the only person in  the store in the last hour. The whole episode probably took 15 minutes,  but man, I was freaked out! The hair on the back of my neck was  standing straight up and I just wanted out of there!   
 I get about 10 miles down the Highway and come upon a scene that looked  like a bomb went off.......4 car pile up involving a tractor trailer  hauling a load of steel that had come loose, State Troopers and  Paramedics just arriving. I pulled over to the side and helped the best I  could, but it was all pretty much over once it began.

On this occasion, the other 2 couples had left their kids at one of their houses, with a baby sitter they were splitting. They invited my parents back to the house to have some more beers that night, but I was being fussy and my mom nixed the idea (though they would 100% have normally gone back to hang out)

I freaked out, slammed the door and pushed a bunch of boxes against it and then went and hid in my closet.

Judy Kirby murdered six children and one adult by intentionally driving the wrong way on a divided highway in an attempt to commit suicide. She had been hospitalized for depression, but had also just ended a relationship with her ex husband's brother and was by some reports involved in drug trafficking and fearing an imminent arrest.

She picked up her sister's son, who was celebrating his tenth birthday that day. She then loaded her three children into the car, supposedly to pick up a gift for the nephew. Instead, she went missing with the carload of kids. A short time later, calls started coming in to 911 about a car going the wrong way down the highway at a high rate of speed. They made it about 90 seconds before a head-on collision with another vehicle, driven by a father with two children and another child along for the ride.

The crash annihilated both vehicles. The only survivors were Kirby herself, and the child who was along for the ride in the other car. There were pieces of children all over the highway. She was sentenced to 215 years in prison.",What is the scariest story you know that is 100% true?,0

My friend had this neighbor who was a retired mechanic. They lived on some properties with large front lawns and long driveways. His neighbor had a couple derelict cars parked up near his garage that he took parts from occasionally.   

This neighbor of his started hearing noises while sitting in his living room, coming from his front yard. Every time he'd go to the window, there would be nothing there. He assumed it was a raccoon or a coyote or whatever. He kept hearing the noise so he'd go outside to look around but would find nothing. He'd put out traps and occasionally catch something, yet the noise persisted.  

Soon, he started claiming that he was hearing voices coming from the front yard, like whispering. He'd go outside and look around the perimeter of his property but would find nothing. It was persistent so he'd started calling the cops. Every time the cops came and looked around and would find nothing. So they told him he needed to stop calling them for this, and perhaps get a security camera or whatever.  

So this guy thought he was losing his mind. One summer evening he couldn't sleep, so he went to the back patio to smoke a cigarette. Suddenly, he heard voices coming from the front of his house. He put his cig out and snuck around to the front and got there just in time to see the doors to his derelict conversion van silently shut. He ran back to the backyard and went inside his home and called the police to tell them what he had seen. The police arrived and approached cold (i.e. without lights/sirens) and when they approached the van, the doors swung open and a bunch of people ran out in every direction.

However, this guy was not a police officer and he did not drive her to the police station but rather, pulled into a parking lot. He then cuffed her, pulled out a gun and threatened to kill her if she resisted. Only, he messed up. He meant to cuff both of her wrist but only managed to cuff one.

One night, I was out at a bar with a friend I was visiting in New Rochelle, NY.  We went outside for a cigarette, and a car came flying past the bar.  The car burned through a red light, and started going up this hill that was on a curve.  We watched as he veered over the double yellow, and smashed head on with another car coming from the other direction.  Both car's hind ends lifted up, then slammed down.  The car that was driving correctly burst into flames.  I ran inside and grabbed the fire extinguisher, then yelled to the bartender to call 911 and say there has been an accident.

My friend, a few other patrons, and me ran to the cars.  Now, I used to think this was a fictional trope, but I was pretty drunk before this happened, and I swear it sobered me up instantly.  I tried spraying the fire, but it did nothing.  The fumes and heat were awful, and all we could do was stand back.  The worst part was, and this will haunt me forever, was that the woman in the burning car was screaming as she died.  My God, it was the worst sound ever.

The fire department came and put the fire out.  The police took us back to the bar and took statements.

I found out the next day in the news, that the car that was not speeding was being driven by a young woman coming home late from work.  She was a block away from home, and I think she was either newly married or a new mother.  The rotten motherfucker driving the other car was some rich drunk cocksucker.  He lost a leg, but otherwise was physically unharmed.  I have no clue if he did time, as I left to go back home a day or so later.

As we sat down after the bell rang, we were told that due to an “unfortunate series of events” Cameron had passed away.

After school, I rushed home to find out that due to the loss of his mother years prior, his father took him to the nearby church and shot him in the head before shooting himself.

Because of the state her body was found in, they could only identify her through matching her teeth to a photograph of her smiling.

Their company collected laundry from large hospitals and medical type businesses eg care homes etc and cleaned them - you can imagine the sort of heavy duty cleaning, bleaching, boiling  etc needed to remove those sort of biological contaminants.

One day a laundry cart went through the usual bleaching, boiling cycle before it dropped out into a conveyor belt to be sorted for drying/pressing when there was a horrid scream.

A small newborn baby’s body had been discovered tangled up amongst the sheets, it had been “cooked”.  The laundry workers were distraught, the whole place had to be shut down, police called and the laundry tracked back to the hospital to discover what happened.

It turns out a (thankfully in some ways) stillborn baby had been left in the cot waiting to be taken down to the hospital mortuary after the parents had said their goodbyes and covered it with a blanket but somehow one of the nurses hadn’t realised (just on shift was the best guess) so just grabbed up all the linen out the cot and off the bed in the delivery room with the body bundled inside and emptied it into the laundry hamper/trolley thing.  The other nurses/parents assumed the baby had been collected by the mortuary to be stored awaiting their funeral decisions.

The laundry was found not to be to blame but the parents were devastated and the hospital took a lot of flack.  The poor laundry workers who discovered the body ended up being given counselling before eventually quitting.  The laundry did amend its practice to individually emptying each laundry hamper into the industrial machines instead of just tipping them in to stop anything like that happening again.

A man who was behind her in a Volkswagen beetle kept pulling up beside her into the other lane (no one was coming) and motioning at her to pull over. She somewhat ignored him the first few times, but he kept doing it and began getting more frantic each time. She said that she believed that he spotted something wrong with her car, so she saw a parking lot off the road for a deserted gas station and pulled over. Once pulled over, she said that she instantly got an eerie feeling. The man was suspicious and kept telling her that he saw something wrong with her headlight and insisted she get out of the car so he could show her what he meant. Her boyfriend who was a few miles behind her, eventually caught up and spotted her car at the sketchy gas station. Right as she was out of the car, her boyfriend began to pull in. As he did that, this man got into his car and SPED off like his life depended on it.

No?! Well his name was Oskar Dirlewanger, and his unit was nicknamed ""The Black Hunters"" or the ""Dirlewanger Brigade"". 

Oskar Dirlewanger was an early adopter of the Nazi party. He had been thrown in jail before for being a pedophile. Eventually when World War II broke out and healthy *ideal* Germans were dying in droves on the Eastern Front, Oskar's old pal Heinrich Himmler (Head of the SS) granted him a command of a unit made up originally of German poachers, and eventually German criminals being held in civilian jails / camps, and military criminals. His unit was essentially designated as a rearguard unit meant to hunt down enemy partisans (or in most cases civilians in occupied countries).  Oskar Dirlewanger SS unit was responsible for many atrocities. Some atrocities so barbaric and bad other SS units reported him and his unit for atrocities. A few examples, which have been popularized in film, include taking an entire village in Belorus and putting them in a church, locking the doors, and setting the church ablaze. Anyone who tried to escape was shot by machineguns and rifles. This unit raped, tortured, and murdered its way through Eastern and Central Europe. During the Warsaw Uprising they were sent to help squelch the uprising. One of their atrocities committed was going in to a children's hospital, telling the nurses and staff that they were there to secure the church. Ok. Once the church was secured they raped the female staff, and some of the wounded and sick female children victims, and then went around shooting everyone. If anyone was found to have survived they were bayoneted.  These guys were so horrible that other Nazis looked down their noses at them, and constantly filed complaints and reports against them, but with no real success. Thankfully by the end of the war this unit was destroyed and its leaders and criminal soldiers were hunt down like rabid animals.",What is the scariest story you know that is 100% true?,0

My friends and I decided to drive up to take a look at it one night (it sat on a few dozen acres). There was no fence and no signs prohibiting access, and all we had to do was take a dirt road for a mile to get to a hill that overlooked the whole property.

Turns out it was abandoned but still owned, and had a caretaker. The caretaker literally drove a truck with the lights off right up to us and then turned them on and tried to ram us. We were able to avoid him but he then followed us at 60 miles an hour off his property back onto the road, then into and past a residential neighborhood, trying to ram us off the road the whole way.

My car and his truck narrowly avoided hitting houses, parked cars, and narrowly missed driving straight into a church before he stopped and turned around.

I know I was on his property, but there were no signs and no barriers, and we were just on the edge of it. That he chased us way past his property and tried to kill us multiple times, and probably felt justified because we were trespassing, still gives me the chills.

I was just ending my shift at a major hospital in New York. I headed back to my apartment, entertained my daughter with random conversation for awhile, had a meal, and was chilling out. Business as usual.

Later that night, my mother came by and took me back to the very same hospital where I worked. We were conversing in the car, and nothing seemed out of sorts at all. She never mentioned where we were headed, and I had no idea of the destination until we actually arrived.

When we arrived at the hospital, I kept getting questioned about who I was (including who I *really* was), where I grew up, who my daughter was, where I lived, and more. Battery after battery of third degree, coming out of absolutely nowhere. I had no clue what was going on or why anyone was interrogating me this way.

Fast forward to about 3 days later or so. I find myself sitting in a chair, calmly looking out at a lovely view from my apartment window.

Except this wasn't my apartment.

In a quiet panic, I took stock of my surroundings and realized I was at the end of a hallway, and I'd been here before. It was the hospital where I worked, but it wasn't in New York. It was Portland, and it was the psych floor. In an instant, I had no idea why I was there, what day or time it was, nor what had gone on since my last shift on the floors beneath.

It turns out that I was, indeed, working a regular shift several days prior. The story is that I walked off the job with no warning nor explanation, went to my mother's place, and was rambling on about what I needed to do in ""the City"" the next day. She took me to the ER, where I reported living in NYC (complete with some bogus address and phone number) with my daughter (I was claiming that my little sister was my daughter). They admitted me, and I didn't break back into generally-accepted reality for several days. When I ""came to,"" as described above, I had absolutely no idea what had happened, why I was locked up again, nor any memory whatsoever of what I'd said or done after that instant walking off of my shift.

Statistically, probably no one reading this has been blessed with the misfortune of dissociative fugue. Sitting in that chair by the window at the end of a hospital hallway, when literally one instant earlier I'd been casually going about my job, felt just as disorienting and jarring as you'd imagine.

I know this isn't a serial killer or drunk driver story, but it's absolutely true, and it's the single most terrifying event of my life. I wouldn't wish that ""instant reality shift"" sensation on my very worst enemy.

Psychosis is a hell of a drug.

Smallpox is a highly contagious disease that is specific to humans.  Insofar as we know, no other species on earth can get or carry smallpox.  

In 1977, the last case of Smallpox was identified and snuffed out.  The disease was eradicated.

However, rather than destroy the final genetic samples of the disease, the cold war super-powers decided to store it.  Some went to the Soviet Union and some went to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta Georgia.

The Soviets began a weaponization program.  

This means that they tried to make a stronger, more contagious, more lethal strain of smallpox.  They tried to cross it with other diseases like Ebola, creating entirely artificial ""chimera"" diseases.

They grew smallpox in the lab *by the ton* and kept it loaded, ready to be fired on missiles into the United States.

But it's not a missile that's frightening.  A single glass ampule of the stuff, smashed against the wall of a subway station in New York or Chicago or Tokyo could spark a global outbreak.

Very, very few people alive today have been vaccinated for smallpox and there are but a scant few doses of vaccine available.   In the event of an outbreak our ability to manufacture vaccine would be rapidly outpaced.  

If the wrong person got their hands on the Soviet Smallpox Bioweapon, billions could die.

Nuclear weapons are bad enough, but they, at least, require a general war to break out in order to bring about an end to human civilization.  A smallpox bioweapon doesn't require a war; just one security breach.",What is the scariest story you know that is 100% true?,0

Anyway, they noticed a girl on the dance floor who looked super out of place. She had sweatpants and a t shirt on and wasn’t wearing makeup and had her hair in a ponytail. She also had a backpack on. Basically, the exact opposite of typical club attire and not at all what someone would usually wear to this place. They said that she seemed very dazed as well, and more importantly, there was a very large man grabbing her and grinding on her and she was just kind of standing there letting it happen.

One of my friends tried approaching her to ask if she was alright but the guy spoke for her and insisted that he was her boyfriend and that she’d just had too much to drink but that she was okay. Everyone was suspicious but at that point there wasn’t much else they could do so they just kept an eye on the two of them. Eventually the guy left the dance floor to go to the bar and my friend was able to talk to this girl again. She said that she was EXTREMELY out of it and that it seemed more likely that she had been drugged rather than just drunk. The girl managed to convey that she didn’t know the man she was with and wanted to leave. So my friend grabbed her and made for the exit, but not before this guy came back. He IMMEDIATELY flipped out, got right in my friend’s face and started screaming at her. It escalated to the point that he eventually swung at my friend who just barely dodged the punch. Thankfully, someone else had went and found a security guard and they were able to prevent this guy from hurting anyone, meaning that my friends and the girl were all able to leave safely. She was still super messed up when they left so nobody could get the full story out of her but she did say that the guy had been following her around town all day.

After that, the remaining survivors made a pact stating that if they died they would be the next in line for consumption, and that the only bodies that would be used would be the families of those who voluntarily accepted to. 

They spent 72 days in the hostile enviroment, by the end only 16 survived. 

The most terryfying story (IMO) is when one of the survivors, who had broken his leg on the crash, which made him feel useless, noticed that the corpses up for consumption was running out.

She got into the house (no one else was there at the time) and instead of going further in, stopped in the first room that held the computers which was right by the door. She went into the room and was messing around on the internet when one of the cats came into the room. Her cat to be precise. 

&#x200B;

Well this cat was super laid back. Loved everyone and never picked fights or got aggressive. He would literally lay down and let squirrels throw pecans at him from trees and do nothing but take it. Not tonight however, tonight he was growling and hissing intermittently while standing between my Wife and the entrance to the rest of the house. A laid back sweet old cat was acting like he was going to rip out a throat. 

&#x200B;

Well my wife decided that this was really fucking weird so she picked up her cat and left the house. Lo and behold she sees a cop car patrolling down her street and flagged them down. She explained the situation and they told (demanded) that she stay in their cruiser while they both checked it out. 

&#x200B;

Turns out they found the back door wide open (super bad, her parents and her NEVER leave the door unlocked much less open). She came to find out later from those cops that they were hunting down a serial rapist that had been spotted in the area and that was why there were rolling down a safe (normally) residential street.

I’m going to be purposely kind of vague about this since I’m figuring the events in this story are rare. (Edit: The stories told in the comments have now made me realize this happens fairly often and that’s very tragic.)

The events are also mostly speculative, since there weren’t any witnesses. I say this to spare you all the multiple “probably”-s and “most likely”-s that would otherwise be in this post. This is how it was told to me:

A family member of mine is friends with a man (middle aged) whose wife sadly died while taking their dog out for a walk through a rural area they where visiting. They had driven up to a farm along the road and gotten out when the dog tore from her grip and ran off. She ran after it to the back of the barn (where the huge open dung-cistern was).

The farmer wasn’t home, so when he came back later in the day, he found her car and thought it weird that a strange car had just been left there, doors open, with no people noticeably near by. He went around searching for his unexpected visitors and eventually found them.

What he found was something I had never even imagined before hearing of this.

The dog had fallen into the cistern of deep, liquid waste from the farm animals. The edges on the cistern where way too high up to reach from liquid surface level and the woman must have panicked, because she had jumped in after the dog to save it and that’s where her life slowly and brutally came to an end.

The fumes that accumulate from that much dung are very toxic. The woman, after being unable to get back out, had lost consciousness and drowned, along with her dog, in a pool of cow shit.

I can’t imagine a worse way to die. I think about it now and then and hope that no one will ever die like that again. Poor souls.",What is the scariest story you know that is 100% true?,0

See it wasn’t just a murder that victims experience for maybe 5 minutes before passing. Or rape that victims experience for 10 before being left alone. 4 monsters kidnapped a girl and not only raped her, but tortured her as if she was play dough for(if I recall correctly, check me on this tho) 40 days. They raped her, lit fireworks inside her, used her as punching bags, burned her skin off, left her out in Japanese winter on her balcony, dropped dumbbells on her stomach and so many more terrible things. She literally begged them to kill her so she could escape the pain. How low does one have to go where your victim sees death as a heaven. And when she did die, they put her mutilated body up in a cement container(again check me here my memory is kinda foggy).

It’s not even a simple case of rape and murder, they quite literally took her as close to hell as possible and literally destroyed her will to live. There simply aren’t any words to describe how vile this act was. 

I highly recommend reading her story anywhere. I have quite a tough stomach but this story made me sick to my core.

It was called the Civilian Conservation Corps.  Participants got room and board, clothing, job training, and $30 a month, of which $25 had to be sent home (most were single young men, so it went to their parents & younger siblings), in exchange for working on various projects on public land throughout the country.  The reasons for it were both to provide jobs and because the Dust Bowl had opened people's eyes to the fact that the US was not a bottomless well of natural resources.  (Erosion was a big cause of the Dust Bowl, and the Dust Bowl was a factor in the Depression, so it all tied together.)  They were also called ""Roosevelt's Tree Army,"" because one of the big things they did was plant trees for erosion control.  

In my state, they built most of the state parks, a lot of them in areas that had been deforested for charcoal manufacturing and were marginal for agriculture.  You can still rent out cabins that they built, and they're great--really attractive, and shockingly inexpensive.  (I'm actually going to stay in one next week.)  Some of them have photos from the CCC days on the walls, and it's really neat to look at them and know that you're still enjoying what they worked on.  

I'd definitely support a program like that today, but I think making it voluntary is (putting ethical considerations to one side) more practical--for one thing, you would have to pay participants (just like people drafted for military service get paid), and it would be very expensive if everyone did it.  Plus having it be voluntary means the number of participants can be matched the amount of meaningful work to be done, and the workers are more motivated.  With the CCC, people considered themselves lucky to be picked--$30 a month was an attractive wage, and three square meals every single day was a significant perk--so discipline was straightforward: do what you're supposed to do or get kicked out, and most people didn't want to get kicked out.  It would probably take stronger incentives to get the same level of buy-in today, but health care and student loan forgiveness would be a good start.

Edit:  A number of people have asked about how you rent the cabins I mentioned.  The ones I'm familiar with are in Pennsylvania and can be reserved at https://pennsylvaniastateparks.reserveamerica.com/.  Not all cabins are CCC-built, but ones listed as ""rustic"" often are--check individual park websites for details.  (There's usually a ""stay the night"" page with information on the cabins, and sometimes a ""history"" page that will talk about CCC's role in the park.)  Rates are based on the number of beds in the cabin and start at $35 a night for cabins that sleep four; weekends and peak times are higher, and there is a surcharge if you're not a Pennsylvania resident.  The system takes reservations up to 11 months in advance--some parks fill up quickly.  Some parks allow dogs in specific designated cabins, and most parks have at least one ADA-accessible unit.   

Other states and some national parks also have CCC-built cabins available for rental, but as far as I know there's no nationwide system to find out where they are.",Would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ?

I generally don't think it's effective or fair to govern over people's lifetime like this, whether it's military service or this type of thing. It would be much more effective to have qualified workers do the work effectively and have all other people study and/or learn other skills as quickly as possible so that you can cut back on benefits, give them the ability to earn money and care for themselves, and as a result also have them pay taxes sooner and longer which will make it easier to fund the environmental projects.",Would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ?

Day 1: 

I enter the room and I entertain myself pretty well for the about the first 10 minutes. Then I itch for my phone and for the ability to scroll Reddit or check my messages. I violently crush those thoughts and try to focus on something else, like what I would do with the money and how much I would allocate to a specific thing. 

I’m also thinking about all the cool things I’ll be able to do and all the countries I’ll be able to visit. Somewhere in the back of my mind the itch to Google something or look something up is always present, but it eventually becomes more wishful thinking than an itch.  

I am able to occupy some of my time this way.

Day 2-4:

Much of it goes like Day 1, except the loneliness is gradually getting larger.

Day 5-6: 

My thoughts have moved past what I will be doing with the money and now existential questions are hitting me, like what will I do with my life from now on? How will this impact my relationships? Is there a God? How do I masturbate without porn?


Day 7-10:

I decide that I must find some hobbies, even if isolated. At this point it’s only been a week but I miss my boyfriend, I miss my friends, and I miss knowing what’s going on in the world. I even miss the Kardashians dammit. I practice singing because at least my voice will only torture myself this way. I try to make up some poetry or fantasize about what kind of DnD storyline I would make up if I was a dungeon master. Little things that keep me creative despite not having things like paper and a pencil.

Day 11:

Sadness and the fact that I’ve had no human contact for 11 days hit. I spend most of this day crying, just hit by a giant wave of loneliness and paranoia about what might be happening in the outside world. What if someone I love was hurt, or worse, DEAD? I would have no way of knowing. That is the most terrifying part.

Day 12-13:

Much like Day 11, but increasingly manic. When I’m not crying I fill the empty hours with sleep.

Day 14: 

It’s getting near the halfway point. I have to struggle it out - I’ve dedicated so much time already. I decide that maybe I’ll write a book about it, and brainstorm thoughts.

Day 15:

I start to sleep more, exercise a bit; being alone with my thoughts make them too loud, so I try to keep myself occupied. 

I start talking to myself a little more.

Day 16 - 30 I can’t fathom really.

1 underwater on the beach

1 out of the city

1 underground

Edit_

Okay, I couldn't wait 7 days, But doing a quick search no one seems to have mentioned my hiding place, which is a huge plus. lol

So, I'm guessing the rules for this would be that you had to recover the key at the end of the 7 days and not destroy it, otherwise you could just totally destroy it or just throw it somewhere it's impossible to get, which would be more 'loosing' then hiding. Or you could attach them to a Helium balloon and wave goodbye to ever seeing them again as they floated off into the sky. 

So, my hiding place is a 2 part thing.

First part is to make copies of the key, these will be placed in obvious, but not so obvious hiding places, hole in the ground, under floorboards in the house, safety deposit box, locker, PO box, posted to me, etc. So if one is found I can pretend it's the real one and wait out the seven days then inform them it's not.

I figure I'd be followed to any location to hide it, it is the FBI and a million dollars where talking about, so the hiding place would have to be pretty good and not an obvious one, somewhere along the way of places your supposed to be, not out of the ordinary. So you couldn't just fly to another country, because this would be totally obvious that you have gone there to hide it.

I would glue some magnets to the keys (or put them in a small metal box with magnet if they have some kind of keyless entry signal). Whilst out shopping find a shelf that is metal, lower down so it's out of eye view, and whilst browsing for my weekly shopping, stick it to the underside of a shelf. 

No one would suspect because I would have already thrown them off by hiding the decoy keys by making it obvious I'm going to locations to hide them.","You are offered $1,000,000 USD if you can hide a pair of car keys from the entirety of the FBI force for 7 days. Where do you hide the keys?",0

I would need to know the purpose of keeping the keys away from the FBI was. Is it something special about this particular set of keys that's a clue to something else? Is it just that this particular set of keys unlocks something important that is magically impossible to pick? (no such thing, and keys are the worst form of security) 

If destruction of the keys is a valid solution so long as they can be re-created later, it's a simple matter of creating a custom cipher from a conlang, one of several that you happen to have lying around, and encode the key's pin codes first in the conlang, and then encode it in the cypher.  Like the Voynich Manuscript, this is a form of encryption that will never be broken. If you really want, you can then encrypt the result from your cypher using something like AES, just as a middle finger to the FBI. This works because it's an unknown language, like the Voynich Manuscript, where there isn't enough information available to produce a sample of the rules of the language. The cypher itself is also a help in that even if it's as simple as a recursive bit-shifting, the output still looks just as meaningless as the input, so you really can't know when you've actually broken the cypher.

If destruction isn't valid, Rent a car, book a cruise, and buy several plane tickets, but hop a freight train to either Montana or Arizona and cross the border illegally, either north into the Canadian wilderness, or south into **Reserva de la Biosfera Gran Desierto de Altar, Mexico** then head for the Wagner Basin. A sailing Canoe on a bicycle trailer being pulled by a mountain bike will go anywhere in the world. Slowly, but it will get there. Once you're off-grid, it's pretty easy to remain that way, especially since you're no longer in the USA. It's theoretically possible to remain in the CONUS, but you have to be a lot smarter about technology avoidance. Either way, you need to be ready to mask your IR signature, which isn't difficult, only mildly dangerous, since you will have to hide from drones the whole time. Personally, I'd leave suggestions that I was going to go south, but go north, since there's a lot more Canadian Border Wilderness, and a whole lot less traffic across it, and consequently, a whole lot less enforcement of said border. Of course, if any time you can use other people to create confusion as well, that's bonus distraction points. So rent that car, but hand the keys to someone who's hitchhiking. Buy bus tickets, someone else uses them, and maybe even agrees to buy a few more at his destination, see if you can't turn it into a ""pay it forward"" kind of thing, where everyone uses your name for the tickets. Within a few days, you could have a thousand people all buying bus tickets using your name all over the continent. (unlikely, but possible) Even if the pay it forward idea fails, it's still a bus ticket in your name that got used rather than one that was purchased and paid for, but not used. That's another lead that the FBI has to investigate. All of the false trails that you lay down that they have to investigate are resources they don't have to be following your ghost of a trail to nowheresville.

This movement is also *accelerating*. Galactic structures will fly apart faster and faster. They will eventually exceed the speed at which we could ever hope to travel. They may exceed or match the speed of light! But that means that light shining from these quickly receding galaxies will ever reach us, and no ship could ever catch up to them.

I've seen a a really good explanation of how big 52! actually is.

Set a timer to count down 52! seconds (that's 8.0658x10^67 seconds)

Stand on the equator, and take a step forward every billion years

When you've circled the earth once, take a drop of water from the Pacific Ocean, and keep going

When the Pacific Ocean is empty, lay a sheet of paper down, refill the ocean and carry on.

When your stack of paper reaches the sun, take a look at the timer.

The 3 left-most digits won't have changed. 8.063x10^67 seconds left to go. 

You have to repeat the whole process 1000 times to get 1/3 of the way through that time. 5.385x10^67 seconds left to go.

So to kill that time you try something else.

Shuffle a deck of cards, deal yourself 5 cards every billion years

Each time you get a royal flush, buy a lottery ticket

Each time that ticket wins the jackpot, throw a grain of sand in the grand canyon

When the grand canyon's full, take 1oz of rock off Mount Everest, empty the canyon and carry on.

When Everest has been levelled, check the timer.

There's barely any change. 5.364x10^67 seconds left.

You may think that such an insignificant difference would label these two universes as being functionally identical, and you would be right. In fact, they are so similar that the multiverse has long since combined them into one reality.

For the first several eons, there was little more than dust, slowly being drawn together by a combination of gravity and electromagnetism. Then, as stars formed and gave birth to planets, and as complex molecules came together, the beginnings of life emerged.

At first, this life was incredibly simple; barely capable of surviving to reproduce, let alone contemplating its own existence. As the ages passed, though, it gave rise to more and more complexity, eventually resulting in beings who could look up at the stars that had birthed them and wonder: ""Why?"" These creatures, driven by something they could scarcely comprehend, set about trying to define their place in world and explain how they came to inhabit it.

They began to believe.

Like the organisms that had spawned them, these beliefs and suppositions grew and evolved. They incited terrible tragedies and sparked incredible developments, until the day that they finally fell away and were replaced by an ever-increasing awareness of the cosmos. However, the original drive – the desire to know and understand – remained, and it prompted the thinking creatures to combine their efforts in pursuit of an answer.

The inquisitive explorers reached toward the stars once more... and when they did, they encountered other beings, not terribly unlike themselves. There were rough patches in these meetings, of course, but as each species learned to understand and cherish one another, they all compounded their perspectives in pursuit of their goal. A single, interlinked mind rose from the trillions of individual beings, just as their individuals brains had risen from tiny connected cells.

It took millenia, but the entity – having come to include every creature in the universe – finally found the answer that it sought... and yet, it was not wholly content. Through its expansive consciousness and unfathomable technology, it was able to know everything that ever was, wasn't, or would be. It could control the whole of existence with little more than a passing thought... and as it contemplated, it realized what it actually wanted.

Space began to shrink in upon itself. Stars and planets were swept up in an invisible wake, being pulled inward at impossible speeds and across countless lightyears. It took eons more, but finally, all of the possibilities and all of the many celestial bodies were brought together in a single point, both infinitely dense and incalculably massive, yet persisting at a size seemingly too small to exist. Tiny adjustments were made and minute (but important) rules were put into place... but ultimately, the end result of the entity's influences would remain unknown.

Then, there was a colossal flash of light.

Planets formed. Life arose. Creatures scurried through the world. Battles were fought, love was found, and an entire history was written across an infinite number of unique minds.

Some of those minds delighted in sharing their stories, while others wanted nothing more than to hear them.

Edit: The visible universe is 98 billion light years across and only 13.8 billion years old. Nothing travels faster than the speed of light.

That's if the universe was static, it's not, the universe isn't only expanding the rate of expansion is accelerating. The size of the greater universe is estimated to be 250 times larger than the visible universe and 7 trillion light years across.

Edit 2: To all the grammar nazis I triggered, eat a bag of dick's.


Edit 3: A lot of comments on how the expansion of the universe can be greater than the speed of light. The galaxies aren't speeding away from each other, the space between them is growing. Picture a balloon, draw some dots on it, now blow it up. The dots are farther apart but but the dots haven't moved, the space between them has expanded. Nothing has moved faster than the speed of light, space has stretched. There is no center to the universe, space is expanding outward from every point in the universe. 


Edit 4: How can the observable universe be bigger than twice it's age? Expansion. We can look into the past and see the light from galaxies that have now expanded so far away that the light they a currently emitting will never reach us.


Edit 5: How do we estimate the size of the greater universe? Age and rate of expansion. 


Edit 6: How do we know light is the speed limit? Math. The faster you go the heavier you get. Accelerating a single electron faster than the speed of light would require an infinite amount of energy. Some people have mentioned spooky action at a distance or quantum entanglement as information travelling faster than light, there are theories that address the problem but that's way above my pay grade.

 • The universe is metastable because of the value of the Higgs mass. This means it's stable enough for now with a lifetime at least as long as the current universe (duh, we haven't died yet), but is destined to essentially be destroyed and replaced by another universe. This is because the vacuum of spacetime is not in its lowest energy state and will eventually quantum tunnel into its lowest energy state. After tunneling, various interactions will be very different, some things will have different masses, and generally the emergent structure in our current universe will be replaced.

 • There is a nonzero (small, but nonzero) chance for you to diffract through a doorway.

 • The energy delivered via sound waves in highly nonlinear, nonisotropic materials doesn't always travel in the same direction the wave travels.

 • Particles only actually exist in the absence of interactions (or can be approximately defined in the case of weak interactions). Consequently, the notion of a ""quark"" or ""gluon"" particle (the things conventionally said to comprise protons and neutrons) ceases to exist in a proton or neutron. (Note: the fields are still perfectly well defined, their excitations just aren't recognizable as ""particles"".)

 • There is an energy density permeating all of space. If you bring two conducting plates very close to each other, there is an energy deficit between the plates, which generates an attractive force between the plates. This is called the Casimir force.

 • 70% of our mass comes from quark-gluon field interactions inside the protons and neutrons in our body. The rest comes from the quark, gluon, and electron masses. Consequently, the Higgs doesn't do much for us in the way of mass. However, if it didn't exist, the nucleons in our body to decay into masses of neutrons and we would die. Thanks, Higgs boson.

 • Spacetime can only support electric fields up to a certain magnitude. Beyond that, the energy density is so high that the photons produce electron-positron pairs and space is filled with a conducting plasma. Plasmas have a screening distance beyond which electric fields can't extend.

 • We can create atom lasers with a Bose-Einstein condensate of atoms. This is literally a laser beam made out of atoms.

 • Gravity couples to energy, not just mass. This affects the trajectory of light. There's a region just outside of a black hole in which a photon trajectory bends into an orbit around the black hole. This results in gravitational lensing.

 • Tachyons are pathological, hypothetical particles with imaginary mass that can travel faster than the speed of light. Due to quantum corrections, if any such particles could interact with anything else in the universe, everything would acquire a complex mass and become tachyonic. (We can thus conclude tachyons don't interact with anything.) These particles are actually permissible in anti de sitter space though.



 • Everything in the universe is expanding away from everything else at an increasing rate. Another comment here does a good job explaining how we can't see all of the universe because it is expanding faster than the speed of light.

 • The Meisner effect freezes the magnetic fields in superconductors. This causes magnets in the vicinity of a superconductor to be frozen in place (well, its distance from the superconductor is held in place, it can still move parallel to the superconductor).

 • If we attempted to compactify the universe and make its dimensions as small as possible, quantum degenerate pressure would force it to have a radius of a few microns.

 • The Mpemba effect is an unusual effect in which, under certain circumstances, boiling water can freeze faster than room temperature water.

 • General relativity predicts gravitational time dilation. It is necessary to account for it in GPS systems.

 • An observer far away from a black hole, we will never see anything fall past the event horizon (takes infinite time). However, the one falling in will see themselves pass the horizon in finite time.

 • If you fall into a black hole with mass greater than 3 solar masses, you'll survive the tidal forces trying to rip you apart as you pass into it. Anything smaller has too great tidal forces and you'll die before seeing the inside.

 • If you aim a laser pointer at the moon, and flick your wrist, the dot can move faster than the speed of light. No information is being transmitted faster than light though, so this doesn't violate special relativity.

Now, if you were to start running at a fast-enough speed, the fireflies behind you would appear to take on a slightly red hue, whereas the ones in front of you would seem to be blue. This is called the Doppler shift, and if you could accurately measure the amount that the colors had changed, you could also calculate your approximate velocity.

Something very similar is going on with the Earth: We can look at the cosmic microwave background – the evenly dispersed radiation left over from the Big Bang – and use that as a frame of reference. From there, we can figure out how quickly we're moving through the universe, which results in a velocity that comes out to about 800 kilometers per second at its fastest. That's enough to make anyone feel a bit dizzy.

Mankind is a blip in the history of the universe that will be snubbed out through whatever accidental and intentional means, and when the universe expires through a total heat death and all particles are alone and lightyears from each other, the existence of mankind will not have had any impact and the memory of all of the things the billions, or perhaps by then, trillions of us will have done or felt or known, it will be as though it never happened.

&#x200B;

The universe, unfeeling and unthinking, gives us no thought, and our impact on it is immeasurably finite. Strangely, we are the universe - our bodies are derived from the death of a star born from the energy released at the moment of the big bang, coalesced into tangible matter, perhaps multiple stars that died and reformed until our solar system contained the proper ingredients for life. We consider ourselves lucky to have existed based on improbably circumstances but our reality is self-contained and our awareness selfish. Thinking ourselves important, we will die a meaningless death. The kindness we show our neighbors will be forgotten, the hatred with which we massacre the guilty and innocent will be forgiven and everything will reach its terminal end. We will then forever be unknown and we never existed.

&#x200B;

The chances are very, very good that entire planets of species, life that carried on for millions of years, have already died in obliteration and the memory of them is eternally lost. Members of our kind have broken hearts over the atrocities of endangered species native to our planet being wiped out, but the truth is every species that has ever lived is endangered. Quasars, supernova, planet collisions, black holes.. the universe will slaughter us and it's only a matter of time. And it will not remember us, and it will not care.

Tyrannosaurus Rex had wings. Not big wings to fly with, but wings that were perhaps somthing like that of an ostrich, cassowary, or emu, although likely much smaller in proportion to their body. Ostriches use their wings in mating rituals, to make themselves appear larger, and to signal and communicate, perhaps T-Rex used theirs for some similar purpose.

Facebook purposely attempts to ruin peoples' relationships because the drama gets more views and more views sell more ads. Several years ago they introduced a feature so that your comments on other pages would show up in your friends' feeds. So if you're secretly an atheist and you comment on some atheist page, it shows up in your devout Southern Baptist Grandma Muriel's timeline, even though it's a conversation that has nothing to do with her and there's no reason for it to be. As a result, Facebook ""outs"" you to your family, and Grandma is typing away at all the evil Satanists trying to corrupt her grandson. And if you comment on a public post, it's unavoidable. You used to be able to control who could see your comments even on public posts by other pages, but at the same time Facebook introduced their ""tattletale"" feature, they took that ability away. Now if they were to stumble across the same page they'd be able to see your comment, but after that change, Facebook started pointing everybody you know directly to it. Not to mention, the privacy settings are difficult to find, difficult to understand, and with each passing year gives you less and less control over who sees what.

By forcibly combining everybody's social circles, Facebook is trying to generate conflict. They want to generate conflict because the conflict happens *on Facebook*, which means people logging on to Facebook more often and seeing more ads. They're essentially an internet tabloid except instead of showcasing the personal drama of celebrities for clicks and sales, they're doing it to *you* instead.

I don't think I believe the theory 100%, but the lack of evidence to support him as a writer is amusing.  

- William Shakespeare was born, lived, and died in a small town, that consisted of not much more than sheep farmers.  His father made sheep skin gloves. 
 Certainly not the life that would have contributed to the knowledge of the many royal topics of Shakespeare's works.  Surely the true author of Shakespeare's works would have had the means to travel, and learn of all the worldly topics that his works were based on.

- We do know that he did own the Globe theatre, and that he did work there as an actor.

- There is no record of his attendance at any schools.

- He was raised in an illiterate household, both of his parents signed all legal documents with a mark (a sign of illiteracy).

- There are 6 surviving signatures of Shakespeare, all of them look as if a 4 year old wrote them.  They were all most assuredly written by an illiterate person.  All of the signatures were found on documents such as a mortgage contract, and his will.  

- There are no surviving original written literary works written by Shakespeare.  There are no surviving personal letters written by him.  Surely a letter written from Shakespeare would be coveted as prized possession, surely destined to survive to the present day.  ([Mozart's handwritten letters professing his desire to poop on his cousin's face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozart_and_scatology#Letters) have survived to this present day, but not a single letter written by William Shakespeare).

- The only surviving written documents, written in his hand, were his Will, and few other small pieces.  All pieces of his writing that have been found were all written in 'secretary hand', a very basic form of writing, typically used by poorly educated people.

- There are no surviving official documents that recall him as being a writer in any way.  All official documents state that he was a businessman, and a real estate owner.

- Shakespeare's will made no mention of any assets related to writings, books, or anything of that nature.  

All these facts paint a picture of a scenario where someone paid William Shakespeare to use him as a pseudonym for their own writings, and perhaps used his position as the owner of a theatre as their own personal venue.  

The best theory about the true authorship was Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.  He was well known to be a gifted poet, and playwright.  He was also known to sponsor companies of actors, and he was a patron of some of the most well known theatres.  Oxford would not have been at liberty to write about the topics found in Shakespeare's works.  

The only compelling evidence that I've heard from Shakespeare supporters are anecdotes written years after his death, by people who knew Shakespeare, and referring to him as a writer.  I don't find this compelling at all.  If Shakespeare made an arrangement to act as the author of someone else's works, surely such an arrangement would require Shakespeare lie to everyone.  I'm certain that all his friends ""thought"" he was a writer.

The information would most likely still be classified, but it could also have helped his rapid accession in politics at such a young age.

Basically, if you look at the counter-culture revolutionaries in the music industry in the 60's, most of them were the children of military intelligence people. So the theory is that the ""free love, lots of drugs"" movement they inspired was done intentionally to distract the youth from a full scale revolution. The thought was if the angry youth of the mid-to-late 60's were too high and getting laid all the time they would stop caring as much about societal ills and then basically sleepwalk through the 70's, which they did.

I stumbled upon this when I was reading up on Jim Morrison and how his father was the one who called in the fake strike at the Gulf of Tonkin that kicked off the Vietnam War, and which was shown later to have been a false flag. Turns out, a lot of his contemporaries were also children of highly placed military people with ties to intelligence.

**Theory from /u/RamsesThePigeon:**

The song ""Tik Tok,"" as performed by Ke$ha, was written by a guy named Benny Blanco. Its lyrics include the line ""We kick them to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger.""

That's a little bit strange, right? Mick Jagger wasn't exactly at the height of his attractiveness when the piece in question came out. Stranger still, it wasn't the only popular song to paint the man in a pleasant light: ""Moves Like Jagger,"" performed by Maroon 5, was released at around the same time, and Benny Blanco also had a hand in writing that one.
This is where things start to get creepy.

The song ""The Time (Dirty Bit),"" as performed by the Black Eyed Peas, features the following phrase: ""All these girls, they like my swagger, they calling me Mick Jagger, I be rolling like a Stone."" It was written by John DeNicola, who used to produce the music for a band called Kara's Flowers... although you might know them better by their current name of Maroon 5.
The song ""Heart and Soul,"" as performed by The Jonas Brothers, contains a verse that ends with ""Making mistakes, but that won’t matter, if you can swag like old Mick Jagger."" Antonina Armato wrote the piece, and she is managed by Downtown Music Publishing. Care to guess who else they manage? (Here's a hint: It rhymes with ""balloon hive."")

This web of connections extends all throughout the recording industry, but one thing remains unclear: What's the link back to Mick Jagger himself? There must be something, because if you have a look at Google Trends, you'll see that his popularity spiked with the release of each song. The only time in recent memory when it has been higher is during a period in March of 2014, when his girlfriend died. Some people have suggested that the man's name is just easy to rhyme with ""swagger,"" but popular usage of the word (in reference to something other than a walking gait) came about after the aforementioned songs had hit the airwaves.

In other words, ""Jagger"" prompted ""swagger,"" not the other way around.

Why does there seem to be a cabal of artists trying to artificially inflate the performer's appeal and popularity? What benefit is there in promoting an aging rock star? Who is actually behind this odd trend?

In order to answer those questions, we need to turn to Vivendi. This is a company which owns a lot of stuff. Their subsidiaries include DailyMotion, UbiSoft, GameLoft... and the Universal Music Group. The Rolling Stones signed to Universal Music in 2008. In 2010, all of the songs listed above were released.
Look at those Google trends again. 2008 marked Mick Jagger's lowest ever dip in popularity, and the slump continued until February of 2010 (right after ""Tik Tok"" became the most popular song on the radio). In September of that same year, The Rolling Stones re-released their rare concert movie, securing the number one spot on four different countries' charts - the US and the UK being two of them - second place on four more, and a Double Platinum certification in Canada.

Strangely enough, though, the only other place (besides the United States) where Platinum status was achieved was in France... which is where Vivendi is located.

What if all of this was carefully planned and executed?

What if there's a shadowy organization that's intent on promoting Mick Jagger for their own profit?
What if I made all of this up on a whim, and just found whatever tenuous evidence I could to support it?

TL;DR: Mick Jagger is a puppet of the recording industry.",Which conspiracy theory is so believable that it might be true?,0

Let’s look at what we know about his death.

* With Germany on the brink of defeat and Russian forces closing in, Hitler shoots himself in a bunker hours before they arrive.

* German soldier then drag the bodies of him, his wife, and his dog into the front yard and burn them beyond recognition.

* The bodies are positively ID’d by dental records provided by the Nazi party.

Given the fanatical devotion the Nazis has to Hitler, it is extremely possible that they would have been willing to shoot and burn body doubles, and alter the dental records of the corpses to match Hitler and his wife. 

Meanwhile Hitler would have been evacuated to a country where he could lay low and take on a new identity. (My guess would be Argentina, who fostered multiple high ranking Nazi officials.)

**EDIT**: Well Epstein just got arrested for sex trafficking minors so this is more a conspiracy fact, not a theory lol

A brief background: **in 2007 dozens of underage women came forward saying Epstein was having sex with them in Florida. They also claimed that he passed the girls along to other elites and ran a sex ring/blackmailing service kinda. Trump, Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey and Prince Andrew are all known associates of Epstein and would go on his plane dubbed ""Lolita Express"" to a private island in the Caribbean**. 

What happened next was ridiculous:

* Epstein hired the best legal team ever(Like as good as OJ's, Dershowitz was involved and all that)

* Acosta was the prosecutor against Epstein and he is now appointed by Trump in his cabinet

* Acosta gave Epstein the plea deal of his life: He was found guilty of one charge of sex with a minor(in spite of being accused by dozens of girls) and had to register as a sex offender

* He got 13 months in jail but he only served 10. Here is the kicker: **he could leave jail 6 times a week to go work at his at home office.**

* He was supposed to go to prison, but stayed in a local jail for some reason
* He was granted immunity
* All co conspirators in the case were given immunity. **This means that if further evidence comes out against other people with the case, they can't be prosecuted again**.
* His house butler was found guilty of obstruction of justice regarding the evidence against Epstein. **he got more jail time(years) than Epstein**

* The police commissioner on the case stepped down because he thought it was rigged
* Miami Herald said it was the deal of a lifetime
* Epstein is now free and still has billions of dollars
* Acosta has told friends that he was scared to go against the powers that be because they would squash his career

* this all happened in 2008 I think. The DOJ just reopened the case last month due to fuckery going on
* Clinton and trump among other famous people like Kevin Spacey have been documented flying on Epstein’s plane to his infamous Lolita express
* a Miami judge just ruled last week literally that Epstein’s case was illegal and violated law because Acosta did not consult the victims before bringing the plea deal",Which conspiracy theory is so believable that it might be true?,1

[/u/BreizhMac post in other Conspiracy thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5f74iu/level_headed_people_of_reddit_what_is_a/)

**The Titanic/Olympic conspiracy**. 

It has credibility because there is photographic evidence. It's really one of the only conspiracy theories I put much belief in.

The sister ships (and their third counterpart, the Britannic) were owned by White Star Line. The Olympic was put into service in June, 1911. She collided with another ship, the HMS Hawke, in September of 1911 and both ships were badly damaged. The accident was a financial disaster for White Star Line, as they were found to be liable for the accident and had to pay for the damages to both ships and legal fees for court cases associated with the accident. Repairs on the Olympic took nearly two months and parts intended for the Titanic, which was still being built during this time, had to be given to the Olympic instead. Only a few weeks after being returned to service, the Olympic suffered another minor incident where one of the propellers broke off and pieces intended for the Titanic were once again cannibalized.

At this point, the Olympic was looking like more and more of a money-drain for the White Star Line, though its achievement in not actually sinking despite a major accident that should have sunk it cemented the Olympic-class liner's reputation as ""unsinkable"", but I'll get back to that in a moment.

The Titanic was finally finished and ready to leave port on her maiden voyage on April 10, 1912, having been delayed while new parts were made and delivered to replace the ones needed for the Olympic, and from there we all know the story. She went first to France, and then to Ireland, and then began her trek across the Atlantic to New York, during which she struck an iceberg and after nearly two hours, sank, taking 1,500 souls with her to a cold, watery grave that would not be seen again by human eyes for nearly a hundred years.

The Olympic went on to have a 24-year career as a successful ocean liner. She served during World War 1 where she earned the nickname Old Reliable for her impenetrable hull, and then in 1919 she was re-outfitted to be a civilian passenger ship and served as an ocean liner until 1935, when she was retired from the fleet. Her ownership changed hands several times and she was eventually dismantled and sold for scrap metal.

But what if it wasn't the Titanic that sank? What if it was actually the Olympic? What if it was a ploy to remove a faulty ship that was costing them more money than she was bringing in for White Star Line and cash in on her million-pound insurance policy?

So here is the conspiracy theory. At some point after the Titanic was completed, they switched the identities of the ships. The new ""Titanic"" was actually the Olympic and the ""Olympic"" was actually the brand-spanking-new Titanic, fresh from the construction yard with zero problems and zero history. They intended for the ""Titanic"" to suffer some sort of failure that would result in the destruction of the problem ship so they could collect the insurance money. I doubt they intended to also cause the deaths of 1,500 people; the events that transpired which led to the sinking of the ""Titanic"" possibly happened purely by chance and the iceberg wasn't part of their plan (i.e., they didn't hire the captain to specifically ram the iceberg to sink the ship or anything like that). They probably had another plan involving the repairs that had already been made on the ship when it collided with the HMS Hawke.

In any case, it wasn't really the Titanic that left port on April 10, 1912 -- it was the Olympic.

After the sinking of the ""Titanic,"" White Star Line received a tidy sum of £1,000,000 in insurance money (or £89,289,575 in today's money). This, of course, ruined the insurer, Lloyd's of London. There's an additional conspiracy theory that American financier and banker J. P. Morgan was in on this whole scheme; his company, J. P. Morgan & Co., financed the International Mercantile Marine Company in the hopes of becoming rich off of sea travel, but this turned out to be a bad investment because of the unpredictable nature of sea travel and travelers themselves. J. P. Morgan or one of his associates may have schemed with White Star Line, who was a subsidiary of this IMMC, in order to bankrupt the IMMC and allow J. P. Morgan & Co. to withdraw from the IMMC without breaking a contract. I cannot provide evidence for this beyond speculation.

However, I can provide evidence that backs up my claim that the two ships were switched and it was the Olympic who sank, not the Titanic.

This is an image of the RMS Olympic in drydock (I am currently unable to locate a picture of the Olympic while under construction with the name clear so you can be sure it definitely is the Olympic -- I can only assume such a photo doesn't exist):

Check out the very top row of portholes in the white railing. Count them. Look closely at the grouping of the last five portholes and how they are clustered with two close together, one set apart, and two more close together.

Look at the top-most portholes in the railing on the Titanic. Count them too. Look at the last five portholes and see that they are evenly spaced apart.

This is a picture of the ""Titanic"" before leaving on its maiden voyage. Check out the portholes in question:

Here is the ""Olympic"" in New York after the sinking of the ""Titanic"":

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Olympic_in_New_York_cropped.jpg/1280px-Olympic_in_New_York_cropped.jpg

There is no reason why the ship builders would have changed the portholes on the Titanic when they were nearly done building it. That piece was not one of the pieces cannibalized from the Titanic to repair the Olympic that would have needed to be replaced by a different piece. The only answer is that the ship in the final picture, which is the ship that left port on April 10, 1912, and was met with a terrible fate near Newfoundland, was not the Titanic, but actually the Olympic. You can find pictures from newspapers further supporting this, as they clearly show the name of the ship and the wrong number/orientation of portholes.

I doubt we'll ever know one way or another, since the wreck at the bottom of the Atlantic is quickly being covered with sediment and will be completely buried and inaccessible soon and pieces of the ship that was retired in 1935 and dismantled in 1937 are both difficult to find and difficult to authenticate, and anybody who might be able to either confirm or deny this theory are all dead.",Which conspiracy theory is so believable that it might be true?,1

This also extends into a larger world of high profile crime that is hidden to the world. 

It is likely that celebrity suicides are often staged to cover up murders related to this secret world (those with a history of mental health issues are especially easy to cover up). 

The Murders of Honey and Barry Sherman come to mind when speaking of this theory. They were a billionaire couple from Toronto, Canada who were murdered in their home which had been staged to look like a murder suicide. The police initially coroborated the story of a murder suicide until after the children of the victims gave a public statement saying the police were wrong, stating it was instead a double homicide. Using a private investigator they revealed evidence in the crime scene that made it clear it was a double homicide. This raised questions as to why the official police statement said it was a murder suicide. For example, both victims were found bound and a belt that did not belong to either of the victims was found around barrys neck.

Their murder happened in december 2017, and there has been very little information released about this case since.

However, there is A LOT of circumstantial evidence that can line up one after the other to possibly link him, or someone else escaping to Argentina. 

Now of course I believe the historical record. Hitler was very sick, crazy etc... and ordered Germany to burn, as it was clearly not meant to win the war. He wanted to be the captain to go down the ship. He wanted his body burned so the Soviets couldn't parade it throw Berlin and then cart it off to Moscow. Hitler knew what happened to Mussolini and his body, and didn't want the same fate. 

BUT there is some interesting evidence to suggest he escaped. A lot of theorists overlook this chain of events for some reason and go for more extreme and less plausible escape methods. But here is mine, based off actual FACT.  

*  April 26, 1945 Hanna Ritsch a female test pilot somehow manages to land her small plane on a highway outside of the Fuhrer bunker, as Soviet Red Army soldiers are shooting at the plane, and as the Soviet Air Force has a ring around the city. During the later part of the Battle of Berlin. Some how she makes it in. What was her mission? 

* Her mission was to bring the new head of the Luftwaffe Robert Ritter von Greim to Berlin to be officially given his orders and appointment as head of the Air Force after Hermann Goering had been sacked by Hitler for what Hitler believed was an attempted coup to take over as the new Fuhrer and run Germany from his Alpine retreat. 

To me this seems an extreme measure to appoint someone as the head of an Air Force that practically only existed in name. 

Von Greim was slightly wounded on landing. Greim and Ritsch spend a day in a half in the bunker.

* April 28, 1945. The pair are given cyanide capsules and a new aircraft. Room is made for them to take off of one of the main axis highways. They fly north. Before they depart a third person supposidly joined them in their aircraft. A man in a German Army (Heer) officers uniform with a trench coat pulled up and collar practically covering his face, and his officers slouch hat pulled down as low as possible. No one got a good look as to who it was. All military officials were accounted for in the bunker. 

* Greim is said to have been dropped off in Flensburg, the soon to be new head of the Nazi Government in the far North of Germany. But Hanna did not stay long and flew for Denmark and or Norway (no official records but eyewitness reports). Denmark and Norway were completely still under Nazi Occupation and had U-Boat bases still in operation. A few days later Hanna Ritsch flies back to Flensburg and that's where she surrenders with the rest of the Nazi Government a few weeks after the war had officially ended. 

* Around this time in early May, a few days later, and a few days before the end of the war two U-Boats left for Argentina: U-530 and U-977. Both U-Boats surrendered not far off the Argentine coast on July 10, 1945 two months after the war in Europe had ended.

* One of the U-Boats was fitted for passengers and cargo. Some of the official documents and log books were destroyed and never recovered. The crew of the boats plead ignorant of the end of the war, but had differing stories of why they were going to Argentina. 

* So this shows an escape route to Argentina for Hitler, had he chose it. 

* Now we must not forget Martin Bormann (The head of the Nazi Chancellery / party Secretary and confidant to Hitler) had been funneling Nazi funds to Argentina for years, even before the war. Argentina was only neutral in name, but financially and politically allied with the Nazis.  

For many years people thought it was Bormann who escaped Berlin and not Hitler. However, Bormann was purported to have been witnessed dying in the attempted breakout of the bunker / chanery area, along with the head of the Hitler Youth Artur Axmann. The bodies were dumped in a shallow grave. The myth continued, but many years ago DNA evidence confirmed that Bormann did die in the Battle of Berlin. 

* Soviet blunders. There was a corpse of one of Hitler's body doubles shot in between the eyes lying in the street. The Red Army thought it was Hitler at first, but upon further analysis by SMERSH / NKVD the body was not Hitler but his double... the bullet hole was from a German rifle. Interesting? Hitler's remains were burned, and charred, but not enough gasoline was found to immolate the remains, so some bits remained like the jaw and bits of skull. These remains were shipped around over years. Recently an American team was allowed to exam a piece of the skull and the couch where Hitler shot himself in Moscow. The skull fragment with an exit wound was that of a female in her late 20s / early 30s. So possibly Hitler's brief wife / long time mistress, Eva Hitler (nee' Braun) but she supposedly bit a cyanide capsule and did not die of a gun shot wound according to the historical record. The blood on the couch also proved to be female, without a trace of male blood. Rewind, in the 1970s the rest of Hitler's remains were further cremated and either dumped in the Elba or Oder River (even the Soviets weren't sure which) so as he could not be mad a martyr and so he didn't have a final resting place. Sounds a little suspicious. 

* The vast majority of the survivors of the bunker who were interrogated were loyal to Hitler and were close subjects. They were mostly SS personnel or loyal maids and secretaries. And all had slightly different stories. Their stories are by far biased. Of course they could lie for Hitler! The only really credible witness to suggest Hitler was in the bunker around the time he died was Siegfried Knappe who I believe was a Major in the Army at the time and was briefly at a command meeting in the Fuhrer bunker because he was aiding the commander of the Berlin military defenses General Weidling. I have read his book and he seems a credible source, and he talks of how outraged and unhinged Hitler was. This was just an Army soldier doing his duty, and was not a political person who was associated with the party. But that's 1, out of dozens of reports that is possibly unbiased. 


So as you can see there is something there. Some very coincidental evidence to suggest Hitler could have escaped to Argentina. But in reality he probably did kill himself in the bunker, although Eva Hitler may have killed herself differently. ",Which conspiracy theory is so believable that it might be true?,0

**EDIT to answer most common replies to my comment:**

>*But google is not free; you are the product*

Yes, that is entirely true. However, google maps can be used without signing into the app. Will this prevent google from collecting location data (a necessity for any map app) and linking it to you personally, probably not, but you can reduce targeted advertising to some extent. You can also [turn off](https://www.google.com/maps/timeline?hl=en&pb) recording of your location information, or delete your recorded location history. In iOS, you can only permit the app to use your location information when in use, which is pivotal for providing any map service, except offline maps.

>*But your cell phone costs hundreds of dollars also, so what is the difference*

Unlike the navigation systems that were (and are still - *as pointed out by many*) available and cost hundreds of dollars, cell phones are multi-purpose devices. I imagine that most of us use cell phones primarily for other purposes than as navigation devices.

>*Waze is better*

I suppose that is personal preference. Waze, also a subsidiary of Alphabet - the parent company of google, is undoubtedly useful and have more info, but I haven't gotten to like its UI.",What free software is so good you can't believe it's available for free?,0

Here are some examples.

[Martial arts vs brute strength](https://youtu.be/-MWrsCoeZfc?t=10m20s)

[2 equally skilled fighters](https://youtu.be/E_h62MOmcs4)

[Animation of guitar playing with magical elements](https://youtu.be/0PAcmuBl_BA) **WATCH THIS ONE, IF ANY.  YOU WONT REGRET IT**

[A 2CELLOS Remake animation](https://youtu.be/wNx8RNKbUDA) of The Trooper by Iron Maiden being played with classical instruments


If you watch any of these at al I'd suggest watching the ""Magical Guitar Playing"" one. The amazing part is that all of the movements like the drumming, fingerpicking, hammer-ons, and the shifting of the weight of the guitar are all accurate to the song. Everything in the video was perfect and it really felt like something that I'd remember for the rest of my life. Maybe aha.

Headphones required.

The man was irate. He didn't take it back straight away as the second half was about to start, but he spent much of the second half angrily lamenting his savoury snack letdown. So he takes it home, calls the customer service number on the back (I assume he had a few choice words for the poor soul on the other end but I wasn't present for this), and keeps the remainder of the sausage roll in the freezer for the next couple of weeks.

Skip ahead to the next match day, my Grandad tells me we're heading out early so he can have his sausage roll replaced. The customer service line told him to go to Kiosk 3 at the front of the ground *next to* the ticket office. When we arrive, however, the shutters are down at the food place. The old man looks around growling and turning red in the face, stamps right over to window number 3 of the ticket office and slams his frozen burned sausage roll down like a fucking flaky gauntlet. At this point I'm trying to convince him the ticket office was a completely different department to the catering concession but my Grandad was having none of it. The lady working the ticket window continually attempted in vein to convince him the same, they sell match tickets not hot snacks, but this just got him angrier and angrier. Across comes a colleague behind the glass, now there's just two people to rage at. Then a head steward comes to attempt to diffuse the situation and my Grandad begins to wave the burnt sausage roll in this man's face, I was actually surprised he didn't whack him with it. At this point I'm mortified by the whole affair, wishing I'd have stayed back at the house until nearer kick off.

Eventually, after an hour or so, the shutters come up on the food concession. Fella at the counter goes 'You must be Mr. Alaginge' and calmly resolves the situation, dispatching a freshly baked sausage roll with the steady hands of a surgeon. My Grandad is completely satisfied with the result of his hour of insolent rage. As we're walking away he turns to me and says 'that's how you get these things sorted.'

Nothing you just said is ok"" followed by me trying to push her wheelchair out of the store as fast as possible with her digging her feet into the ground trying to get me to stop so she could go back to trying to ruin someone's day and me wondering if I'd go to jail for elder abuse if her ankles snapped in the process because **nothing** was going to stop me getting her out of that store.   I got her into the car and then went back in and apologized till I was blue in the face.  I wish I could say it was an isolated incident but it definitely wasn't.      
If by any cosmic chance any sales clerks or phone reps that had to deal with my grandmother read this thread I am so so incredibly sorry, I apologize on behalf of my whole family and I'd give you a hug if I could.     

As an interesting side effect of caring for her, I have a tendency to wander off and pretend to look at things when we get to the register if I'm with someone and I'm not the one paying.  I think she gave me an honest to god phobia.    

**EDIT:** Thanks for the helpful suggestions about pulling the wheelchair backward next time.  She passed away two years ago so it's thankfully something I won't have to deal with for awhile.  I'd never experienced someone digging their heels in before and I was sort of panicking trying to get her out of the store before she tried anything else.  I think under any kind of better circumstances I would've worked it out.     

**EDIT 2 Bonus story edition:**  This one thankfully happened at home but is nevertheless I guess equal parts amusing and equally awful as the other story in hindsight.  It was some kind of special occasion, probably one of our birthdays because we were all sitting at the kitchen table eating cake.  The nightly routine was we all sit down to eat dinner and she'd put the tv on the evening news which we'd halfway listen to.  They were talking about something political and said ""Blah blah blah...and the House Judicial Committee approved this.""  My grandmother caught that one line and said, ""The Judicial Committee?  Those damn Jews.  What are they doing with all these committees?""  I got caught somewhere between wanting to laugh at her misunderstanding and wanting to make some kind of noise of horror and instead I just inhaled sharply and aspirated a gigantic mouthful of chocolate cake and coughed so hard and so long that my mom wound up having to take me to urgent care because it set off my asthma.

They are not fun to go out to eat with. 

The “most embarrassing experience” is actually their most embarrassing  experience, one where I   Embarrassed them. 

My wife and I pride ourselves on being a “relief” table when we go out to eat. Both of us have been servers, and there’s always the counterpoint to the difficult table, that’s us. Barring horrible service or bad food, we are super easy customers, tip well, and try to have a good time with our server. Furthermore, we just treat people nicely. So you can imagine our distain when my parents act like they’re fucking royalty at a dinner service. 

My wife and I went out to dinner with them. They were being particularly tough. My mom was acting like she was Gordon Ramsey analyzing the business, critiquing everything down to the amount of bubbles in her seltzer (“looks like it’s time to change the CO2”) My step dad was getting more and more heated over stupid things like the amount of ice in his drink and how the waitress didn’t top off his water, that he was barely sipping on, fast enough. 

It came to a head when my step father ordered a steak medium well, it came back medium well, and for some reason he changed his mind that he wanted it medium rare while it was cooking and they didn’t read his mind, so he gave attitude, as did my mom. They jumped really quickly to demanding free stuff.

I’m an adult and this may be the first time they realized this. I interrupted in front of the server and said something like “really? This is what you’re doing. That’s what you ordered...” I turned to the server and said “We do not need anything comped.” I then pulled out my wallet and handed her my card and said “this is for the bill. We’ll happily wrap up with what we have here. I’m very sorry for their behavior, you’re doing great.” Then the line that stung them so deep they still bring it up years later ...”I was taught to treat people nicely, a lesson that seems to be forgotten. Thank you.” 

They turned red, the server walked away, I looked down and cut my steak, and didn’t say a word. They were so flabbergasted that the meal was virtually silent except me asking my step father how his steak was a few minutes later. I signed the check, gave a big tip, and we walked out and said goodbyes.

They’ve been nicer to servers each time that we’ve gone out since.

I must have been around 19, which makes my one sister 16, and the youngest around 9. My dad had been planning this for a year, and we were psyched to go.

After you go into this place, you see a huge lake, and on each side there are several shops. A restaurant there, a souvenir shop there. And also, there is a Build-A-Bear shop. This shop is NOT a part of the park itself, but it does have an entrance from the park.

Anyway, my dad didn't have custody of my sister at the time, and only saw her very sporadically. This was by his own choice, since his anxiety meant he couldn't care for her properly. She lived with a foster family. This was one of maybe three times a year he got to actually take her somewhere, so this trip was a BIG deal.

He told her she could have ONE thing from the park, whatever she wanted he would pay for it. And, being a 9-year old girl, she said she wanted a Build-A-Bear.

My dad was unfamiliar with the concept of Build-A-Bear, so he didn't know that the price of the bear isn't the total price. On top of it comes the clothes, the shoes etc. So the shop person takes my sister through the whole thing. You know, stuffing, putting the heart in etc, and rings up the total.

My dad totally lost it. Like, red in the head, screaming at this poor girl in the shop lost it. And I felt SO embarassed. Firstly, this girl didn't make the prices. Secondly, this was THE trip of the year, it was all four of us for the first time in forever. And thirdly, you don't yell at people like that.

I get that he was angry, since he didn't know the process, and felt cheated. And also, he felt backed into a corner, since he had promised my sister that she could have anything. But you don't do that. Ever.

Luckily, the rest of the trip went by without a hitch, and my youngest sister doesn't remember this happening.

Growing up, my dad was sheriff of a small town.  I must have been around 8-9.  He was brought in after the previous sheriff was booted out for political reasons/stealing city funds.  That was a really unpopular movie, since he was super popular and spread his money all over town and let people get away with murder. 

That sheriff was out and my dad was brought in.  Everybody hated him, in part because they loved the old sheriff and also because my dad was an ""outsider"" even though he came from about two towns over...he wasn't of their world, so he could never be fit to see over the village. (It didn't help that my dad was a raging asshole with a stick up his butt for the rules).

One day, my dad was dressed in his full uniform and took me alone to the local corner diner.  Like, one of those places straight out of Roadhouse.  We sat down and ate the full dinner, and my dad lectured me something about ""respect"" and ""the rules are all we have.""

Then the waitress came in and dropped the check.  My dad looked at it, and it said the meal was free.  My dad then excused himself and went up to the waitress.  I kept to myself, and doodled on the napkin and the next time I looked up, my dad was full on SCREAMING at the woman.  He was straight-up shaking. 

She tried to explain that free meals is how all cops are treated in this town, and my dad was FURIOUS that he would get special treatment, that police are put above the normal laws.  That the police have rules they must follow, and not accepting kickbacks is one of those rules.  And that it especially happened in front of his kid, who he's trying to teach right.

Everyone in the diner was quiet and just staring at him.

It was a weird situation because it was a moment where my dad showed a lot of integrity, but also a story of a 6'7"" man with a gun on his belt screaming at a tiny little waitress.  It stuck in my head as a clear picture of the contradictions that our parents are.  Like, a lot of the good comes from them but at the same time a lot of the bad.

**EDIT:**  This kind of blew up more than I was expecting, so I would like to promote...not being an asshole cop who beats your kids!

**EDIT EDIT:** Quit sending messages telling me how shitty my dad was.  He's not a hero and did some really shitty things in his life, but I'm still his son and it's not fun to hear from a bunch of strangers tell me how my dad sucks.  You didn't know him, you don't know his full story, you just know a slice of life told by one person.  The point of this story is that people are complicated and that we're full of contradictions, it's not to give yourself another excuse to feel good about yourself on the internet. 

He was a guy who beat me and my brother, had anger issues, was painfully insecure and closed off...but also was a noteworthy cop.  He rose through the ranks and as a white man, brought progressive racial policies to his department in the 1980's that to this day are still radical.  He was an innovator as a police administrator.  I'll put it like this; he did heartbreaking things to me, and yet I found room to forgive him.  Through a long and painful process, I found room to forgive him as an adult.  Not excuse his behavior, but put peace in my heart towards my feelings towards him.  Whatever opinion you have of him, keep in mind that from your computer, it is one that is really easy for you to have, and for me it is and will always be a really difficult one for me to have.

This waiter was amazing. He was working 8 tables that I could count and was managing all of them flawlessly. Drinks never got below 1/3rd full at any table, he was always attentive and prompt, friendly, just a textbook example of the perfect waiter. He impressed my dad so much that my dad asked if he could speak to a manager. Of course, the waiter immediately asks if anything is wrong, since that's the only time someone asks. My dad tells him no, it's to make sure that management knows what excellent service he's providing. The waiter thanks us and says he'll get a manager over as quickly as he can.  


We wait for about 10 minutes before this middle-aged grease ball of a manager saunters over and starts asking my dad how the waiter screwed up. My dad is not the most patient of people, and we were kinda in a hurry to get home, so the 10 minute wait was rubbing him wrong. But when the manager immediately acted like the guy was a screw up, my dad lost it. He told the manager that the waiter had done everything perfectly, and that's why he tipped the guy $15 on a $35 ticket. He also went on to say that the manager needed to be more respectful of his staff and gave the guy an ass chewing for presuming that the employee had screwed up. Before that moment, I thought that my sister and I were the only ones he would scream at when he was upset.

One of the most useful things I learned from working in retail is knowing how to recognize the warning signs of when someone is looking for a reason to be justifiably confrontational. We'll call this person ""Susan"".

-

Susan comes in and wants to return a pair of shoes that she bought two months ago.  They have clearly been worn.

The official policy is that refunds have to be made within 30 days of purchase, with the receipt and still in ""like new"" condition. Regardless, I can approve this refund and **Susan knows it**.

She does want her money back, but more importantly, she wants to win the refund. She wants to be put in a position where she needs to convince me to give her the refund. It's like how people will buy something just because it's on sale, even if they don't need it -- it makes them feel as though they're ""special"" because they were smart enough to beat the system. Her objective is the refund, but she also gains a feeling of power through her method of acquiring the money.

-

Susan will tell me this story about how she wore the shoes only once; it was to some event where her son was being recognized for finding the cure to cancer or something. However, the shoes hurt her feet and she was forced to suffer through this ordeal all evening. She couldn't walk for days after that, which is why she couldn't return them any sooner.

The implication of her story is that I'm responsible for the torture she experienced, as I am the one representing the store where she made her purchase. She is the victim and I need to make it right. She isn't actually saying this, but she's coming as close as she can to presenting that idea without spelling it out. The appeal of being passive-aggressive is that you can always deny what it sounds like you're saying, and if a conflict does happen to occur then it's because the other party started it; you're only defending yourself.

Susan is aware that she is the customer and that the customer is entitled to a certain degree of respect. This allows her to be difficult without it necessarily being unreasonable for her to do so. Due to this logic, she will keep insisting that the store's policy is ridiculous and that her circumstances allow for this transaction to be an exception to the rules.

-

She will continue being difficult until I show **any** sign of agitation. Maybe when I'm repeating for the fourth time what I can/can't do to help her, I roll my eyes or I sigh out of frustration.  Hell, even if I'm trying my best to sound pleasant, she might perceive my tone of voice to be facetious and condescending.

It's already over. She's won.

*How dare you to speak to the customer this way! I want your district manager's number! This is unbelievable. I am never shopping here again!*

She does this routine because it works. Virtually anyone in retail will just cave and give her what she wants in order to make her go away. She feels a sense of accomplishment because that horrible guy at the shoe store was trying to take advantage of her and she put him in his place.

-

She knew that she could have gotten the refund if she had just asked nicely, but doing so doesn't come with the bonus feeling of superiority; control.  Maybe she seeks out these situations because there's some other part of her life where she feels as though her choices don't matter, but I'll leave that for another wall-of-text.

-

**tl;dr** Some people will look for reasons to be justifiably confrontational, no matter how absurd their line of thinking may actually seem. They know they're being ridiculous, but they convince themselves that you're being worse, thereby making their outburst rational by comparison. What always worked for me was to just [be Gus Fring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbuq3vTy2IY) and bear in mind that the instant I lose my composure, they win.

Edit: u/Stamboolie [made a comment below](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b0ox0w/children_of_i_want_to_talk_to_your_manager/eigmgdt/?context=3) that I think is worth addressing here for the purpose of visibility.  The goal of this post was to illustrate how to recognize when someone is taking out their bad day on you.  Sometimes, it's a customer, but it can also happen with people in your personal life.

Every store has multiple managers, each with their own authority to use a fair amount of discretion however they see fit.  That is to say that there certainly are ""Susan"" managers.  For every manager that is happy to accommodate a somewhat difficult request, there is also one who will deny your refund for the same reasons mentioned above.  They're attitude will be, ""Nope.  These are the rules.  Sorry.  Have a nice day.""

My thought is that **more often than not**, people (in retail and in life) will treat you with the same respect that you treat them.  If a customer spends their hard earned money and then feels cheated because the product didn't live up to their expectations, I recognize that it sucks and I honestly want to be able to help.  Ultimately, my budget for accepting damaged merchandise will be just fine, and I get to feel as though I made someone's day a little less hectic.

In exchange, I just need to know that if/when *my boss* asks about it, I can be comfortable with my choice.  It may be a slap on the wrist and a little extra paperwork, but it's not the end of the world.  I just don't want to be in that situation for the benefit of someone who rationalizes talking down to people the way that ""Susan"" does.  If I allow it, it only encourages her to do it again to someone else.","Children of "" I want to talk to your manager"" parents, what has been your most embarassing experience?",0

My mother and I had to get new military dependent IDs when my dad retired. We made an appointment at the ID office and we were stopped at the gate because our current IDs were no longer valid. Mother tries to yell at the poor marine just doing his job, expecting to get an exception and be let through. No dice, this is a super strict base so we are sent to get temporary passes. They have to confirm our identity and it takes almost an hour. My mother is fuming by this point because no one in the office is giving her a special exception either. No manager available, and no one is willing to hurry the process. We arrive 25 minutes late for our appointment to a full waiting area. The only lady there (who is running the front desk and all the stations) let's her know that being more than 15 minutes late forfeits the appointment slot, and the next available time is about an hour in a half. My mother starts to have a meltdown in front of a room full of people and I just stand there mortified. A waiting room full of military men is watching her scream and almost cry. She gives the lady an earful, and the woman decides to let us get our IDs next because my mom is making such a scene. My mother is smiling at this point, thinking that she has finally won. Lady starts processing us and come to find out my father had not done all of the paperwork. Mother starts demanding an exception and that the lady give us a break. She explains that she can't and my mother storms off. I give the lady a quick ""sorry"" and scurry on after. We return the next day and the same lady is running the office.  The tension was palpable and I was so embarrassed and uncomfortable. I could tell the woman was taking her time to make my mother squirm, but mother couldn't have another meltdown and risk having to come back another day so she was just fuming. My mother still doesn't know that my father called and apologized to the woman after. I wish she would figure out that people are more likely to help if you're nice.

&nbsp;

The people running the place had - I shit you not - run out of lettuce.  And I've never dealt with dumber people.  Instead of just... telling people they were out and letting it go, they were being idiots and saying ""There'll be a small delay..."" 

&nbsp;

It was a super hot day, the AC was broke, we're exhausted, all we *really* want is some water, but we're stuck in the drive thru line waiting and waiting as ... they try to figure out how to make lettuce out of thin air? You'd think there'd be another bag somewhere or something but... maybe that was too complicated for them. 

&nbsp;

So - twenty minutes into sitting cooking in the car trapped between other cars in the drive through and unable to go forward or back or even sideways ( speaker and signs, even if we wanted to jump the curb) and my mother is just cursing up a blue streak about the stupidity of the people involved, screaming her damn head off about 'just fucking make some lettuce free tacos you dumb shits, what do you use for brains, the fettid remains of your blasted out assholes' - I remember much of this very vividly as I was about 12 or 13 at the time, and I was learning all sorts of new words and phrases.  My little brother took notes. 

&nbsp;

That's when we see some taco bell teenage idiot employee boy make a break from the building and go sprinting across the parking lot over towards the grocery store across the way.  *They sent out a fuckhead to go buy some lettuce...* 

&nbsp;

The cursing rises a few notches.  NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE FUCKING LETTUCE.  JESUS FUCKING CHRIST JUST LET US OUT OF HERE YOU LITTLE ... etc etc etc.  Volume. Variety. Viciousness.  Mom hits all the good Vs. 

&nbsp;

Forty five minutes or so after we got into this - the car at the window (a couple ahead of us), which is probably the real villain of the story (why wouldn't they fucking leave without lettuce? Wtf?) finally gets handed something ... and they don't leave immediately they have to fucking talk for a while before they drive off.  

My mom is a volcano past it's sell by date and just frothing at the mouth now, but *eventually* ... they pull off and leave and we can pull up to the window. 

&nbsp;

What I've left out of this story is... my family, for a few years, would participate in parades as clowns, handing out candy to the kids at the side of the road and dancing our way through the parade route to the rocking tune of ""Cel-e-brate good time To-Night!"" on repeat.

And this day was one of those days - we were all in full costume.  Makeup, super baggy rainbow pants, rainbow wig, big flower on the suspenders, big ole ridiculous shoes... the whole deal. 

&nbsp;

So the car finally pulls away ahead of us, and my mom, who for the last hour has been a spitting bulldog of bile and vindictive rage and a constant criticizer of the drive thru window people's ancestry and breeding... realizes she has to pull up and face them in full Clown Regalia to get our stupid tacos. 

&nbsp;

I remember that moment when Mom realized it.  The mix of anger, embarrassment, ridiculousness of it - and eventually the humor of the whole situation - went through her and she started laughing so hard she was crying. 

And when the people behind us started honking for us to just GO (they'd been waiting too) - it just got funnier somehow.  

&nbsp;

So now mom is not just a crazy angry lady - she's a Crazy Angry Clown Lady, and more than that - she's a crazy clown lady who's been sweating and now crying too.   So she's not even a crazy clown lady with good makeup anymore, she's just a wreck of a crazy clown lady. 

Which makes her laugh even harder. 

My brother and I thought she was going to die.  I mean, she couldn't breathe, and those outfits, the heat, hell - the whole reason we pulled into this place was we needed water...

&nbsp;

To give mom credit, she didn't just squeal out of there flipping everyone the bird - she got herself together, pulled up to the window, looked up at the girl through the car window with her ruined clown make up and big rainbow wig, and handed her the money very calmly, said thank you and took the bag, and we drove off. 

&nbsp;

I hope to hell they remember us.  I know I'll never forget the look on the drive thru girl's face as we drove up and she started to try to apologize for the delay and... just ... stopped.  Staring at us. 

&nbsp;

But shes not the type to push her way through lines and would only talk to a manager if really need be, but due to her stern and scary personality she can really draw attention to herself.

One incident when I was around 8 or 9 was when we had to pay our immigration fees, this wasnt in the US btw but in the Philippines.  We arent Filipino citizens so we need to go both to the US embassy then the local immigration offices to pay our yearly dues while living there.  The immigration processing line was long...like DMV long & slow.  Not to mention the office was infamous for having really lazy workers who only speed up the paper work when there's a bribe.

My mom after 2 hours of waiting had enough, she actually knew the Vice Chief at that time...went to school with him. And this is how the conversation goes

Mom: I want to speak to the Chief Wiggum (simpson name here).

Officer: (scoffed at mom) Sorry but you cant just MEEt-

Mom: (cuts her off and leans in & in a low drawl) Tell Chief Wiggum, Marge is here. He know who I AM.  (looks at me then the officer). He knows who we are.

Officer had a look of panic, asks a co worker to watch his booth, and leaves.  About 10 mins later this Jolly fellow, bit of sweat on his brow comes by. Hugs my mom and gave his officers a look.  Mom took me by the hand and we were ushered to his office.  

In the 15 mins we were there, our papers were personally processed by him.  In the next few years we would just walk into his office to get this done and had this perk till he passed away.

Learned later that day of my memory, Chief Wiggum was in a board meeting when he got called and abruptly left. Due to my mom's actions it was assumed she was his mistress and me the love child.  He got quite the teasing of a lifetime bec of that. 

As a note: My mom was the alumni secretary of her school, is also one of the most beautiful in her class and is a badass.  I never knew Chief Wiggum has been to our house many times during reunions.  Many of my mom's classmates moved to being big bosses in govt offices and she pulled this prank a few times much to the amusement of her friends.  They love her to bits.

So, she took the shoes and marched straight back to the Foot Locker store and *demanded* we not only get a refund but also a replacement pair. For 10 minutes she argued that they're puma shoes, so they should be held to a much higher standard and shouldn't scuff so easily Jo matter what. All I could do was hold my head down as she argued with these poor minimum wage cashier's about this topic.

To make matters worse, the customers in line behind us started arguing with her too and telling her that puma or not, shoes scuff and suffer damage. It happens. She was having none of that either. After about 20 minutes of back and screaming forth (from her end), she insulted them a bunch and they threatened to call security, and the line she kept shouting back at them was ""why? Am I stealing from you?!"" (During and After the fact, she seemed to truly believe that that is the only reason why security would be called...).

Security was called, came over and escorted us out of the place. The whole way home, she kept uelling and screaming about it and shouting ""I should've split the shoes open with a knife. *THEN* they would've *had* to refund and replace.

He did it in a loud and commanding way that we had the attention of the restaurant. I noticed (i was an early teen so memory is a bit foggy) that many many people were in the same boat as us so when dad got up and said what he said people noticed. I melted into my chair embarrassed.   


The Manager came over and after apologizing and calming my dad the manager in a normal tone of voice causallu mentioned that the kitchen had run out of chicken and that everyone 'is in the same boat so sit down'.

Yup, you guessed it, dad exploded. WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE CHICKEN RESTAURANT HAS NO CHICKEN?! He turned, looked at us and said, We Are Leaving.

I got divorced about 2 years ago (Jeez that long already?). My ex-wife was an alcoholic and a cheat and while my life is certainly better without her now, it didn't feel like it for a long time. I was dedicated to her fully and having that ripped away made me a single pringle for a looooong time. 

My VERY first date in 10 years was about a month ago after finally working up the courage to ask this cute girl at my school out, and it was just fucking awful haha. This girl was a menace. Took that ""I'm bothered by your presence"" tone with the waitress, talked to her like she was an idiot, corrected her on her pronunciation of a dish, criticized her haircut, and was just a bitch. Then would immediately turn to me and smile as if looking for confirmation, and was super nice to me the whole time. It was a jarring experience to say the least, but it culminated with Ms. Hyde (she has since been called anytime I tell this story) returning her drink to the bar because it wasn't strong enough, then wanted to speak to a manager. 

We hadn't even received our food yet. 

She started complaining about how the waitress had been rude, and seemed to not care about us at all, so the manager called the waitress over. By this point I was just floored and I couldn't take it anymore. As soon as the poor girl came over to us I turned to her and said ""I'm sorry, I'm going to have to cut this off. Here, use this card for MY order, she will be paying for her order because this date is suuuuper over. Please have the cooks make this order to go. Whatever her order was going to cost, please add it on to the bill as your tip. I'm terribly sorry for her behavior, you have been fantastic and I appreciate your grit in being able to still put on a smile for someone so toxic."" 

The manager's eyebrows hit the ceiling, and the waitress quickly hurried off to process the bill. 

Ms. Hyde was less than thrilled, told me to go fuck myself and said she will be getting an Uber ride home and stormed off. I got an extra hug from the waitress when she brought me my meal, and on my way out I caught sight of my ""date"" getting told she wasn't allowed to leave until she paid her check or the police would get involved. 

Boy can I pick 'em...

Fuck those who are rude to service people of any kind. ","Children of "" I want to talk to your manager"" parents, what has been your most embarassing experience?",0

When we got home, he looked in the bag and didn't see the nuggets, so he called up McDonald's, asked for the manager, and screamed at them that they needed to DRIVE TO OUR HOUSE with fresh nuggs. 

The manager actually did, and apologized profusely at the door and my dad took the hand-delivered nuggets from him and slammed the door in this poor manager's face.

When he walked into the living room to give me my lunch, he found me eating the McNuggets that I had taken out of the bag in the car before we got home.","Children of "" I want to talk to your manager"" parents, what has been your most embarassing experience?",0

Got it home, took it out of the box, and it wasn't the model that was supposed to be in there. It was also clearly used.

Back to Best Buy we go. For us at the time, the nearest Best Buy was an hour away, mind you. My dad assumed that this would be an easy return/exchange, but first the employee and then the manager refused to accept it. He told my dad he'd have to contact the manufacturer.

While he was arguing, my sister and I were shopping and had found CDs or whatever that we wanted to buy. While we were at the register, everything came to a head. My dad angrily told the manager that we would never do business with Best Buy again. I'd already paid and my dad insisted that the employee refund our money. The manager had to come over and do some kind of override to process the return at the register.

The manufacturer eventually did send my dad a new receiver. He didn't set foot in another Best Buy for years.

This story is a little contrary to the spirit of the question, because my dad didn't make a habit of speaking to managers. And now as an adult, I can completely understand his reaction. But to teenage me, it was incredibly embarrassing.","Children of "" I want to talk to your manager"" parents, what has been your most embarassing experience?",0

2017, I pre-ordered Pokemon: Ultra Sun version and called my local gamestop where I had ordered my copy at, if they were doing a midnight release. The girl I spoke to said: ""12 AM"" I asked twice to be sure. She said 12.

We go there, there's a bunch of people in line, all for the same game and we see a guy in the store. We're waiting. Midnight... than twelve fifteen... Finally a guy whips out his phone, cause he's got his kid with him and dials the store, puts it on speaker so we could all hear.

The idiot they left in charge, said: ""Oh. We already did the midnight release at eleven."" 

We had to clarify. He thought. Midnight. Was. At. 11 PM. And he made it very clear, we weren't getting our games. At all. He was not going to let us in, even though he watched us all stand out there for  almost half an hour in the cold. We all had the same story, they told us 12 o clock.

We all got into our cars and in a caravan to WalMart, we all recognized each other and bitched about game stop all the way to the electronics section where a dude pulled out even better editions of our games. Editions that came with keychains, when the gamestop copies did not have them.


The story should've ended here right? Except... Gamestop made me pay a fucking deposit. I leave a review on the local store's facebook page and agree with some people who were also upset at their dishonesty... The next morning, I wake up and my facebook page is going off like crazy. 

I had two employee's from two different gamestops, yelling at me, insulting my intelligence and making fun out of me and calling me stupid and selfish on that page. I tried to explain to them that what they were doing was harassment and one dude legit told me: ""I'm one of the managers, I can do whatever I want to you.""

I showed my mom cause I wasn't sure what to do (I live at home mind you and get anxious talking to people). Mom sees RED and tells me quietly, to get me her cellphone and get the corporate number for gamestop. I take screenshots of everything, the employees' facebook pages where they openly stated they worked for Gamestop and screenshotted their comments and circled them in MS paint. Mom lights up corporate like the 4th of July, being polite but firm about how she didn't appreciate harassment and asked if they thought that's how they wanted their brand recognized because she assured him, she was going to ruin business for that store. Got the names of the employees who were there at the store that night as well. 

He has us email him the screenshots and he tells us, he'll get us a gift card.

The bastard who was there that night, was at the store when we went to pick it up and he was making us jump through hoops to get it. Even though he was warned and he was being extremely rude, telling us what HE thought was correct and that we were wrong.

Mom jotted down his name and told him, she hoped he can learn to say ""I hope you like fries with that"" because she was fucking DONE. Not a teenager either, guy was in his 30's.  Mom was never rude, but she made it very clear she was PISSED.

Again, lit up like the fourth of july. 

She got the people who were harassing me online fired as well as the guy who was being an ass at that store fired.

It was honestly, one of the times where it was absolutely needed because it shouldn't have had to go that far.","Children of "" I want to talk to your manager"" parents, what has been your most embarassing experience?",0
