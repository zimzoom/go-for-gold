I had the pleasure of working under him for some pop culture conventions and all he wanted was to see fans smile and enjoy his legacy.  He loved to joke with those around him, and he would tease the ever loving hell out of everyone he could.  

I remember him using his motorised scooter to get around backstage and his poor assistant would speed walk to keep up with him, but he would just keep increasing the speed until she was running beside him. A wicked grin on his face the whole time. 

Or how he would constantly make his staff repeat themselves ""what I didn't hear you!"" Untill they had repeated themselves four times, witnessing that initially made me sad, thinking his hearing was poor, until he looks at me with that same grin and winks.  

My time with him was short, but I'm so glad I got it, this man changed my life before I even met him, and he made a huge impact when I did as well.

Here we were, just average idiots in a place we weren’t supposed to be. 

We approached, just wanting to say hello and thank him for his work. The handlers were not having any of it and started to move us along. He stopped the handlers and said hello to us. I got to shake his hand and thank him. He asked if we had cameras. I was kinda dumb-struck by the moment, and forgot cameras existed. He actually wanted to pose for pictures with us.

Still have the photo, and a nice memory of a pretty great guy who was good to his fans.

About 4-5 years ago I was in Chicago going to school for animation.

Comicon was in town but I had to work and didn’t have the money to go anyways.

Anyways I worked at Dunken Donutes and got good with the owner so I was basically his errand boy. 

I was delivering bagels and donutes to another store on foot. I was standing at the corner of wabash and another street, forgot the name, waiting for the light so I could catch a train to another part of downtown.

Next to me was this old man with white hair and shades. I am a pretty talkative person but instead I found myself just staring at him.

He caught me staring and raised his eyebrows at me. I apologized and explained that he just looked so familiar...


He winked at me and said, “I get that a lot.”

Turned and walked away. About an hour later I found out Stan Lee was in Chicago for that Comicon and I’ve been kicking myself ever since.

He was up there with Toriyama Akira and Hayao Miyazaki for me. The people I’ve always wanted to just sit down with and drink coffee.

Spider-Man was always my favorite, because I was a weird kid and found spiders fascinating. I loved him more as I grew up, because there were so many similarities: raised in poor families beset by financial troubles. Quick with jokes to cover insecurities. A deep love of science that shaped everything I did. The implicit knowledge that I may not be the strongest, or the toughest, or the most resilient, but that I always had to stand back up. Intellectually gifted and, with it, a compulsory, driving need to use that to help people. It's why I became a scientist researching psychiatric illnesses, and then later Alzheimer's disease, because I recognized that I had a gift - and so I had a responsibility.

Spider-Man is paper and ink, but he is an ideal I always have, and always will, aspire to. He is my hero. And the man who helped give me that ideal, who shaped so much of my childhood and identity, has died, and the world is a sadder place.

I knew Stan Lee before I knew who the hell he was. He was the guy with the cool voice who narrates my spiderman game on N64 when I was a child. It wasn’t until years later that I learned it was his voice, but even before then I learned the name of Stan Lee. He helped create my favorite superhero, Spiderman. He gave my father a line of comics to pass down to me and form a closer connection between the two of us. And he created a character who taught me that I’m not powerless just because I was a kid. 



While it’s easy to write off comic books as a child’s entertainment medium, his work really did have a lasting impact on my life, and that impact has in turn helped me touch the lives of others with his works. I NEVER discuss this outside of my clinical setting, but I use the themes and tropes of Spider-Man in my practice to help clients, many of whom are not particularly intellectual, understand concepts like codependency and hero complexes. Thanks to Stan, I’m able to explain very complex ideas to my clients and help them overcome what I’ve come to call “Peter Parker Syndrome.” So, even beyond his personal impact on my own life, I owe Stan Lee a great debt. 



His is an influence that will be missed. Marvel games, movies, and media at large will simply not be the same without him. Through the act of creating superheroes, Stan Lee himself became a superhero, a household name that influenced generations of people all around the world. May he Rest In Peace, but may his legacy continue to resonate with men and women of all ages for generations to come.

Edit: since people were asking what “Peter Parker Syndrome” is, I’ll copy/paste my response here. It’s an allegory I use to illustrate certain themes:


It’s how I explain codependency and hero complex to clients. 


I started by introducing Spider-Man and his real identity. I outline to my client that, once Peter gets his powers, he goes all in on being spiderman. A running theme in the books is that spiderman is the real identity, and Peter Parker is the “disguise.” 


Anyway, Peter goes all in on being spiderman, and it starts to fuck with his life. He loses his girlfriend, drops out of school/loses his job, and loses touch with family. But he doesn’t care, because he gets to be the hero and that’s what matters most to him.


Time passes, and a villain shows up. Wipes the floor with spiderman. Then he realizes that the one thing he cares about, being the hero, he can’t even do anymore. In some storylines, he gives up and puts away the costume. Slowly but surely, he rebuilds his life. He starts dating again, re enlists in school/gets a new job, starts having hobbies again. And for the first time in a long time, Peter is happy.


Then the villain comes back. In the absence of anyone else who can help, he inevitably puts the mask back on and fights. And he wins. And what he learns (and then unlearns because the universe is reset) is that, in order to be a good spiderman, he has to be a good Peter Parker. And when Peter suffers, so does Spiderman.

I then relate the client’s self care to their “Peter Parker” and their desire to be there and care for others to their “Spiderman,” to illustrate that they cannot engage in the selfless acts they want to if they do not take care of themselves first.


A seemingly simple idea that a lot of my clients struggle to wrap their head around. I then have them keep a running tab of how Peter Parker is doing each day to find gaps in self care.",Stan Lee has passed away at 95 years old,0

I learnt more from spider-man about responsibilities then anyone.

She walks all the way up to Stan and he talks with her for a minute or two and signs the photo.

That’s where I saw Wizard magazine (#34) for the first time, which featured on its cover an illustration of Rogue and Psylocke of the X-Men. I was somewhat familiar with Batman, Spider-Man, and Superman, but I really didn’t know of any female superheroes (aside from Wonder Woman, who frankly seemed pretty lame to me as a kid) at that time. I bought the magazine, and for months, it was an obsession for me. I read it over and over again. I started buying comic books, drawing characters, reading the stories out loud in the voices I imagined each character to have, dreaming up new powers and imagining new worlds. What I loved about the Marvel universe was that there was room for everybody: men, women, people of different races, nationalities, ages, abilities, and backgrounds. It made me feel like comic books were something that everyone could enjoy. I shared my love for comic books with my brother. Although he struggled in school and teachers couldn’t get him to focus, he would pay attention when I read The Uncanny X-Men to him, and when he finally learned to read, it was because of comic books. Thanks to Stan Lee for showing us that anyone can be a hero. RIP. ",Stan Lee has passed away at 95 years old,0

He was being escorted outdoors, along the main glass hallway where all the talks were happening. It was so hot, and he was wearing his signature yellow sweater vest and keeping pace with his assistants. I couldn't believe my eyes. I was just hanging outside, and there he was, steady as he goes. I yelled at him the only thing I could, "" I LOVE YOU STAN!"".

I didn't expect him to hear me since there was a good amount of distance between us and he was hurrying to his panel (The Amazing Stan Lee). But no, with double barrel fingers towards me, not missing a beat, that firm, unmistakable Stan voice we all have grown accustomed to all these years, I hear, ""Love you too!"".
 
Many years later me and three friends go for a group photo. There was a kid before us, and Stan made sure to take time with the young boy and not let the photographs rush thier moment. 
Once our photo was taken. I noticed how smaller he was now, not weak, but small like my own grandma. Instead of thanking him, I just told him I loved him. He didn't hear me but it didn't matter. 

Out of all the stories and heros and villans he gave us, Stan was the truest hero and champion of our hearts and imaginations. 

Stan was the man. He never let us down, and in his memory I/we should try to be like Stan. Ever moving, bending, steadfast, and fighting for the future for ourselves and others in ways that we can.

First of all, he lived a long life. 95 years.

They played them over the voice over, so it was louder and actually sounded like an emergency vehicle was close. I'd gotten fooled more than I'd like to admit by it. I always checked my mirrors to see if any emergency vehicle was coming, luckily none ever did. It got to the point where I stopped listening to it all together. My view on it is that they could desensitize people to sirens ""Oh just the radio station again"" and I would assume people have blocked emergency vehicles without realizing. People already do it enough as is. I'd be happy if they removed any sounds that are meant to grab peoples' attention while driving such as sirens, horns, squealing tires, or wrecks just to name a few.

Hear me out - I discovered through therapy that I needed a mechanism for judgement-less and objective self-analysis and Mr. Spock is that dude. He can see the most fucked up space shit ever and react calmly and objectively.


Mr. Spock: ""The massive space blob has a 97.454% chance of consuming the ship and everyone inside within 4/7 minutes. Projections show it will be slow and painful.""


Kirk: ""That's horrible!""


Spock: ""Yes, it is not ideal for our continued survival, but it's actions are entirely within the nature of the space blob.""


So, whenever I get spun up on something in my head I imagine a mini-Spock in my head with a science terminal that can pull all data about ME. 


me: ""Spock, science report.""


Spock: ""Data shows that godspeedmetal is 5.8 days from quitting smoking tobacco and is under great mental distress from the change of chemical intake. He isn't consciously aware of it, but he's attempting to make up an excuse to get gas on a half-tank in order to create an opportunity to buy a pack of cigarettes.""


me: ""Thank you, Spock, sounds like I'm being dishonest with myself. I suck!""


Spock: ""I disagree. It's entirely within the nature of a nicotine addict to seek out a source of nicotine intake. This is neither Good or Bad. Just natural. Data also suggests that conscious awareness mitigates the chances of nicotine intake by 89.45%. You've yet to procure a nicotine source as well. Commendable.""


Just going through that mental exercise will help knock me out of a mental spun-up state, help sort out emotions, feelings, all that stuff, into a parsed, objective, and most importantly, non-judgemental way.

EDIT: holy shit, I'm happy this was received as well as it was. This mechanism has helped myself so much, however I'd offer a couple of words of advice if you are intending to take on this method as well because it can be a frustrating mechanism to employ if you don't have your expectations set correctly. 

One - Spock's reports WILL be amended, appended, referenced and reworked entirely. This is all part of the process. Even Spock had several times where extended analysis was needed to understand something in order to create a way to cope/overcome/whathaveyou. Don't treat everything he says as immutable truth - his analysis is only as good as the data he is able to receive through that mental science terminal. Your initial reports will upgrade that terminal for stronger analysis in the future.

Two - You WILL fail, as well, and that's totally OK! He's analyzed far more for me than just smoking - everything from anxiety, struggles with work, and interpersonal relationships has been reviewed through that science terminal. But sticking with the smoking report as an example - recognizing that ""getting gas"" was just an excuse to get cigarettes didn't come from a single analysis, but was referenced from a prior ""science report"", as at one point I had quit smoking, went to get gas a few days later and drove away with a pack of cigs in my pocket. Spock reported, ""godspeedmetal formulated a reason to create an environment that allowed his weakened will to procure a source of nicotine. Further analysis shows that nicotine addiction is extremely subversive to godspeedmetal's psyche at a subconscious level. The strength of control the addiction exerts upon his mind is quite strong. *Fascinating.*"" Spock doesn't judge me - it all is what it is - and I respond, ""That IS fascinating! My mind is stranger than I ever thought possible. However, I am more in control because I now recognize this pattern of behavior. I believe that this can be identified at a later point if I do this again. Thank you, Spock."" That failure to stop smoking at that time was an opportunity to learn about myself. And FYI - I'm several months smoke free and still going!

Three - this isn't to make someone an emotionless logic machine, either - Spock understands human nature is an emotional experience. Humans get horny, sad, happy, angry, depressed, excited - all of that stuff that comprises the human condition - it's all part of the Logic of Being Human. Take that into account, yet strive to be aware of your humanity and make conscious decisions on what you do instead of sub-consciously reacting emotionally.

Four - trust your intuition. Your instincts have been developed over millions of years of evolution. Your mind is *powerful* and can sub-consciously recognize threats and boons to your world and yourself. Even if you don't understand *why* your guts are reacting they way they are, don't dismiss it. Run it by Spock and if you don't come to a satisfactory answer, you can always revisit later when you've more experience, time, and data.","Anthony Bourdain once said ""There's a guy in my head, and all he wants to do is lay in bed all day long, smoke pot, and watch old movies and cartoons.

* Commercial Spaceflight - Its literally here right now, but its going to get even cheaper in the future. The next step will be space tourism, but that won't be accessible to the average person for a few decades at least.

* Space Construction - We've already done this with space stations, but cheaper commercial spaceflight will encourage larger buildings in space. Instead of launching completed modules like we have in the past, we're going to be launching subdivisions of modules that will dwarf even the ISS. I'm incredibly optimistic about whatever happens to be the ""next ISS"".

* Asteroid Mining - This one we probably won't see in our lifetimes, (unless the futurists are right, and the first person to live to 200 is alive today). However, the potential of asteroid mining is astronomical! There are individual asteroids with more platinum and tungsten on them than the entire Earth has available. Once we have these materials in excess, who knows what new developments we'll see. Aluminum used to be exceedingly difficult to refine and rare. Once a reliable refining process was developed, we found a myriad of uses for aluminum that changed the world. I predict we'll see similar benefits from improved access to rare metals found abundantly in asteroids.

* Space tourism - Now that we've got commercial spaceflight, and space construction is on the horizon, space tourism will become a booming industry. I'd be excited to spend a week on a luxury space station in the future. 

* Mars - We're definitely going at some point, whether it is publicly or privately funded. I doubt there are any monsters there, or that we'll have any visitors forced to grow potatoes with their excrement. However, Mars is the next logical destination for humanity's domination of the solar system. I hope I live to see the first colonization effort!","With all of the negative headlines dominating the news these days, it can be difficult to spot signs of progress.

That's easy - the past.  People live in this weird bubble of time that seems to them to encompass everything but in reality is the tiniest fraction of a drop in the bucket of human society.  We really just don't have a good sense of how *bad* things used to be, even only just a few hundred years ago.

A few examples: look how upset we get when ISIS does something horrible, like burning someone alive or murdering everyone in a village.  It's front-page news.  It's a huge outrage.  But five hundred years ago, it was *totally normal.*  It was something *governments* did, and not just now and then but as a matter of course.  ""Kill the men and enslave the women"" wasn't seen as barbarous, it was just business as usual.

Hell, let's one-up that.  Five hundred years ago in South America, motherfuckers were *eating each other* like it was something to do.  The entire continent was run by massive empires of cannabalistic slave-holders who thought about human sacrifice the way we think about American Idol.  We think about how brutal the Conquistadors were by our standards; realize that the people they pushed out of power were *even worse than that!*

Shit, look at the last century!  Communism killed a hundred million people, Nazism got a few tens of millions more, and that's before we go into all the ""minor"" genocides here and there.  We are *so much better off* than people can possibly comprehend.

Congressional members aren't paid from annual appropriations and are paid through a salary not based on hours worked, but as their status as members. More importantly, members of Congress are constitutional officers. The President (and life-tenured federal judges) is also a constitutional officer and also cannot be prevented from carrying out their duties except as allowed in the Constitution. As such, they're all constitutionally entitled to pay.

Article 1, Section 6 of the Constitution:

>The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.

27th Amendment:

>No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.

It also functionally wouldn't do much besides perhaps damage the one or two financially untenable younger members (AOC for example). The shutdown and pay being withheld impact only those employees that *need* that money imminently, which is not the vast majority of Congress and certainly not the President.

If you're making 500K selling your soul to a big corporation, than your check for being a part of congress is an after thought. Mean while freshmen senators who realistically spent nearly all of their money on campaigning to get into congress and change a broken system will be the only ones to suffer. 

So this could just help the spread of corruption against high ranking government members. Although why should they be exempt from suffering the way TSA workers or Prison workers do?

I feel that instead of stopping anyone from getting payed, if a budget isn't agreed upon, than we have an emergency 3 months airbag where we pay federal workers for those 3 months and essentially use the previous budget. If those 3 months go by and still no movement is made, then there should be repercussions for congress and the presidency. Something along the lines of an immediate replacement of all leading members of congress and a removal of the current president. This later one is dangerous because there are times that congress would be willing to kill it's self to kick a sitting president out of power, such as republicans during the Obama administration, and I suspect Democrats during the Trump administration.

Additionally congress should be forced into a minimum of 8 hour work days with the president sitting in on the meeting trying to find a compromise. There should be no vacations, time off, or excuses with the exception of terminal illness. If a member of congress fails to show up, they would effectively be removed from congress, and if the sitting President or Vice President is not there than their power to veto a budget will be removed and it would only take both houses to confirm a budget.","[Serious] Americans, would you be in support of putting a law in place that government officials, such as senators and the president, go without pay during shutdowns like this while other federal employees do?

I think people should be organ donors but it should be something they consciously decide to do, not because they didn't get around to filling out the paperwork.

Their parliament, the Althing, has been in continuous session since 986 - not 1986 - and has a rather unusual track record of keeping the interests of Icelanders at the forefront of its decisions.  Every Icelander's DNA is stored at a central repository and companies like decode Genetics have access to this DNA; along with Iceland's unique patronymic/matronymic naming system and the records of the Althing, many avenues of research, from the geneaologic to the medical, are available.  The Althing granted broad consent for this work in the early 2000s and although individual Icelanders may opt out only a few dozen had done so the last time I looked into it.

I think Iceland's relative cultural homogeneity, its small population, and its position as the only society inhabiting a place that is rather forbidding 6 months out of the year has something to do with making this possible.

About ten years ago my mother at age 69 had a massive stroke. They didn't expect her to live let alone come out of it mostly alright. Which she did except for some vision loss in her left eye. (Not total, just peripheral.) So she can only see perfectly straight out of that eye.

So after about a year recovering from the stroke and the ensuing infection from the surgery that ended up being worse then the stroke itself she decides she wants to go get tested to see if she can retain her drivers license. (Required by law in my province of Canada).

My father was not well either as he had a long term terminal illness so I pack them both up in my truck and take them to the DMV. Me and my father happily assuming there is no fucking way in hell she will pass. 

Aside from her vision issues, the amazingly quick witted and swift woman I grew up with was VERY unsure of her self at all times and took forever to make the smallest decisions. It broke my heart and it didn't even occur to me to be scared that she would get her license back.

Well she did, passed with ""Flying colors"" the DMV guy said. As a SAR (Search and Rescue) tech, the idea of taking him up in the helicopter and throwing him out without a rope occurred to me.

1 week later, accident number one. T-boned a poor lady as she was coming out of the grocery store. Not much damage and no injuries thankfully. Mother still refused to admit she wasn't fit to drive.

Month later, accident 2. She panics on a multi-lane cross city road and ends up on the raised median and rips the entire exhaust system off her car. Still won't admit any issues.

At this point I'm amazed I didn't have ulcers. Shortly after accident 2 my father passed away. I did everything up to and including begging to get her to give up the license. She wouldn't do it and for the next few months I spent every day with a knot in my stomach until I spoke to her around 6pm every night once she was ""home from running around"" 

Then around 1pm I get a call from her cell phone, this phone I bought her that she mostly ignored except to charge it. I couldn't understand a word she said she was so upset on the phone. I managed to get her general location out of her and hopped in a car and more then exceeded the speed limit getting down there.

Upon arriving there are two ambulances, shoes in front of her car and its up on the curb.

She's sitting on the curb next to it bawling her eyes out and I'm terrified she's killed someone.

Turns out a man and his son were walking out of the soccer pitch next to the road, began to cross on the cross walk and she didn't see them.

She thankfully only struck the father and aside from being banged up he wasn't super seriously injured.

Because of my job I knew most of the police officers in the city so one of them offered to follow me back to her house so she could take me back down to get her car.

By the time I had done so and got back to her condo she had stopped crying. Threw me the extra set of keys to the car she had and told me to get rid of the car.

She even tried to get the DMV worker that passed her fired after that. She immediately realized she shouldn't of ever gotten it back. She was actually terrified that she had been driving like that.

Years later she still comments about how she never even saw the man and his son and how she could of killed one or both of them.

I have all the respect in the world for seniors. My mother was one of the first women CEO's in this province and was a hellcat in her day. I learned a lot from her. But I also learned to accept limitations.

If you are older reading this post. If you think for even a second that you could maybe not be the safest person to be on the road, talk to and listen to your loved ones.

Its horrible to give up that freedom, it would be more horrible for you to kill some innocent person because you are too proud to give it up.
